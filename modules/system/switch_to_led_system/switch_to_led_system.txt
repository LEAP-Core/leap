Switch to Led System

This is a connected application foundation that
accepts a value from the front panel switches
and displays the result of a computation on
that value on the front panel LEDs. 

The calculation is variable since it is a plugable 
submodule of this module. The interface to the
calculation is in the form of a request and response.
