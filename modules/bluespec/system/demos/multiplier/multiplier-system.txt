Multiplier System

This is a simple demo that uses the front panel services
without soft connections. It allows the user to enter two
2-bit values into the front panel switches and then
when the center button is pressed multiplies those two
numbers together. The multiplication is done with via
serial additions and the result is presented in the
front panel LEDs.
