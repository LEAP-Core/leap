This directory contains module definitions for the LEAP virtual platform.

LEAP takes a specific physical platform and translates it into a well-defined
virtual interface (middleware). This includes everything from device-specific
structures (BlockRAM, clock PLLs) to abstracting specific peripherals
(e.g., using the same interface to communicate over JTAG and PCIE) and includes
data packetization and marshalling (to take into account endian issues and 
bitwidth changes).

channelio/                      Device independent bi-directional multiplexed 
                                channel.
low-level-platform-interface/   Instantiation of the physical platform and 
                                hardware-abstraction layer.
physical-channel/               Hardware abstraction layer for physical
                                devices for communication like PCIE and JTAG.
rrr/                            Remote Request-Response protocol for HW/SW
                                interaction via method calls.
vico-headers/                   Stubs for interacting with the VICO 
                                co-simulation environment.
virtual-devices/                Platform-independent device interfaces.
