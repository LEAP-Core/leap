RRR Clients and Servers

This module provides the functionality for Remote Request Response clients and
servers. These can live either in hardware or software, so that both parts
of a HW/SW hybrid application are treated as peers - either can initiate
a request on the other.

A hardware-only version of the environment is provided so that SW versions
that do alternative marshalling (such as ViCo or SCe-MI) can be supported.
