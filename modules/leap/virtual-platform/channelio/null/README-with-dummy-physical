The NULL channel I/O with dummy physical channel variant exists as a temporary
measure until multi-FPGA compilation properly unifies dynamic parameter spaces.

The current version does not handle dynamic parameter enumeration in dictionaries
correctly, leaving different namespaces on separate FPGAs when the set of
AWB parameters is not the same on each FPGA.  Inclusion of the physical channel
makes it possible to have a NULL channel I/O but still import the names that
are on FPGAs with host channels.
