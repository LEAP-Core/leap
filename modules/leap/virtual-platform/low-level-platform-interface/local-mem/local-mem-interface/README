Definition of the common interface for all local memory implementations.

The interface is a BSH file instead of a BSV file because it requires some
platform specific types that are defined in platform-specific local_mem
implementations.  To avoid a circular dependence between the interface and
the platform-specific code the platform-specific code includes the interface
definition once all required types are defined.
