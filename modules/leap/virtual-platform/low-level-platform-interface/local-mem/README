Local Memory Interface

This module represents an abstraction layer for memory that is private to the
HW. This could be accomplished using on-chip Block RAM, or by using an 
off-chip device like DRAM or SRAM.

local-mem-ddr-wide
local-mem-ddr-narrow
    Both these modules map DRAM/SRAM with variable word sizes and numbers of
    banks into a linear address space of local memory lines and words.  The
    local memory line and word sizes may be different than the physical
    memory configuration.  DDR memory often passes data as beats over multiple
    cycles.  The local memory code manages multi-beat memory references,
    converting them to single message requests.  We define a "burst" to be
    with full data value passed over all beats.

    The "wide" variant should be used when a physical memory burst is the
    same size or larger than a local memory line.  The "narrow" variant
    must be used when when the physical burst size is smaller than the
    local memory line size.  In the narrow case, multiple bursts must be
    combined to form a local memory line.

local-mem-null
    For platforms with no local memory.  This may be used even when the
    platform has a DDR memory driver.  As a side effect of choosing this
    module the central cache is disabled.

local-mem-bram
    Obsolete implementation of local memory using on-chip BRAM.  A better
    choice would be local-mem-ddr along with a BRAM physical memory driver.

local-mem-interface
    Interface definition typedefs.
