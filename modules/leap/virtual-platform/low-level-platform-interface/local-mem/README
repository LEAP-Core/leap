Local Memory Interface

This module represents an abstraction layer for memory that is private to the
HW. This could be accomplished using on-chip Block RAM, or by using an 
off-chip device like DRAM or SRAM.

local-mem-bram.bsv          Local memory using on-chip BRAM.
local-mem-ddr2.bsv          DDR2 local memory for off-chip memory.
local-mem-interface.bsv     Interface definition typedefs.
local-mem-null.bsv          For platforms with no local memory.
