Low Level Platform Interface

LLPI is the layer which is responsible for instantating the platform-specific
Physical Platform (found in other repositories) and the Hardware Abstraction
Layer responsible for transforming this into a LEAP virtual platform.

local-mem/               Abstraction layer for memory local to HW only.
remote-memory/           Abstraction layer for memory shared between HW and SW.
platforms-module.{h,cpp} Base class definition used for virtual platform SW.
