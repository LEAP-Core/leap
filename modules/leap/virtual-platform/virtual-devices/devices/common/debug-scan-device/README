Debug Scan Device

This device provides the functionality of scanning out state on demand.

SW requests a dump, and all nodes respond with their current values using RRR.

This is clearly not useful for debugging problems in the physical channel
itself, but is useful in diagnosing a large range of application-level
bugs, especially deadlocks.

Relevant values are indentified using LEAP dictionaries:

def DEBUG_SCAN.MYMODULENAME.PROGRAM_COUNTER "MYMODULENAME: Program Counter";

Applications that use Soft Services can interact with Platform Services,
rather than interacting with this device directly.
