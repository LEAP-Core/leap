Dynamic Parameters Device

This device allows SW to send values to set registers in HW. These values are
set once when the HW/SW application initializes, and thus act like dynamic
parameters to the FPGA's configuration.

Parameters are distinguished using LEAP dictionaries:

def PARAMS.MYMODULENAME.INITIAL_PROGRAM_COUNTER "Initial program counter value."

Parameters can be set when the ./run.bmark script is invoked as follows:

./run --param MYMODULENAME_INITIAL_PROGRAM_COUNTER=1000

All dynamic parameters in the system can be listed as follows:

./run --listparam

Applications that use Soft Services can use Platform Services to create
parameters rather than interacting with this device directly.
