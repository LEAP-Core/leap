Common Utility Devices

This is a collection of devices that are generally useful across every
HW/SW hybrid application (assertions, stats, etc). It is somewhat analagous
to "stdlib" in C.

A null variant is provided, but is probably only useful for extremely
degenerate platforms.

All of these devices make extensive use of LEAP Dictionaries and RRR.

assertions-device/          Handles dynamic assertion failures from the FPGA.
debug-scan-device/          Scans out relevant FPGA state on demand (deadlock)
dynamic-parameters-device/  Allows SW to send runtime parameters to HW.
stats-device/               Read out relevant statistics when a run finishes.
streams-device/             Allows the HW to perform basic print-outs.
