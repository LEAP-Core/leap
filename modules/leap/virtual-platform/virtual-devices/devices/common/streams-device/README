Streams Device

Streams represent a way for the HW to do a "printf"-type printout.

Messages are defined in advance using LEAP dictonaries:

def STREAMS.MYMODULENAME.PROCESSING_STARTED "Began processing data: %d";

Up to 2 32-bit "payloads" of parameters may be included, identified by the
presence of "%" in the dictionary string. More than 2 are not currently 
supported.

Different modules may maintain different streams using the STREAMID dictionary:

def STREAMID.DEBUGGING "A stream for debugging messages only.";

The default stream is named STREAMID.MESSAGE. A special entry, 
STREAMS.MESSAGE.EXIT has the side effect of ending the program with the
given exit code. This is useful for cases when the SW part of the HW/SW
application is empty.

Applications that use Soft Services may interact with this device using
Platform Services rather than interfacing with this device directly.
