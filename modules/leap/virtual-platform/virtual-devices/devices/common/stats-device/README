Stats Device

This device allows the HW to report statistics to SW at the end of the run.

Statistics are stored on the HW in counters of limited bitwidths (28 by 
default). When these counters overflow in the middle of a run, this is reported 
to SW immediately, which can update the value in a much larger counter.

Some statistics can represent vectors. These vector lengths can vary dynamically
and are queried by SW when the HW/SW app is initialized.

Stats are identified using LEAP dictionaries:

def STATS.MYMODULENAME.BRANCH_MISPREDICTS "Number of branch mispredictions."

At the end of the run the statistics are reported in a comma-separated value
(CSV) format.

Applications that use Soft Services can interact with the Platform Services
for statistics rather than interfacing with this device directly.
