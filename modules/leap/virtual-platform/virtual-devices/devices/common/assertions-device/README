Assertions Device

This device allows the HW to report dynamic assertion failures. When a failing
condition is noticed, SW is alerted using RRR, and then is responsible for
reacting based on the severity of the assertion.

When a HW system defines multiple assertions, they should be defined using the 
ASSERTIONS dictionary. For example:

def ASSERTIONS.MYMODULENAME.UNEXPECTED_VALUE "MYMODULENAME: Received unexpected value!";

For efficiency, assertions are reported to the device in vectors (default size 
16). Note that multiple assertions can fail at once, and that the order that
they are printed by software is dependent on the order they appear in the
dictionary.

HW/SW applications that use Soft Services can interact with the assertions
device using Platform Services, instead of interfacing with the device directly.
