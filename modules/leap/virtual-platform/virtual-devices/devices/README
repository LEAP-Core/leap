This directory contains individual virtual device definitions.

These devices are all platform independent and depend on the LEAP
hardware abstraction layer to hide the "bare metal."

central-cache/      A large cache that uses HW Local Memory.
common/             A set of useful common utility devices.
front-panel/        A panel representing basic FPGA IO (LEDs, switches, buttons)
scratchpad-memory/  An automatically inferred cache hierarchy of local memory.
shared-memory/      A coherent memory space shared between HW and SW.
starter/            Starts and Stops the FPGA if needed.
