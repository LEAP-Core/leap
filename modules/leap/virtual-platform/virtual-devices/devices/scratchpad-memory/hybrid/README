Hybrid Scratchpad Memory Device

This module implements LEAP Scratchpad Memory, which combines multiple
independent private memories onto the same cache hierarchy. LEAP RRR
is used to access SW memory as a secondary backing-store when the HW
local memory is too small.

See [FPGA 2011] for a complete description.
