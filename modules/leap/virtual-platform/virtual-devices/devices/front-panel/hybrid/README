Hybrid Front Panel

The front panel represents an abstraction of basic FPGA I/O devices such as
LEDs, buttons, and switches. The Hybrid Front Panel is capable of emulating
these devices in SW using a small GUI program called "leap-front-panel".

This can be useful for porting applications to platforms that do not have
physical buttons or LEDs.

Applications that use Soft Services may use the Platform Services to interact
with this device rather than interfacing directly.
