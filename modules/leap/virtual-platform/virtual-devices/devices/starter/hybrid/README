Hybrid Starter Device

This virtual devices is responsible for synchronizing the start and end of
a run of a HW/SW Hybrid application.

SW can invoke two methods:

Start()             // Tell the FPGA to begin.
WaitForHardware()   // Block until the FPGA calls end.

HW can invoke two methods via RRR:

Heartbeat()         // Periodically let SW know HW has not deadlocked.
End()               // Tell the SW that the FPGA is finished.

For applications where the HW acts as a "pure server" that simply processes
requests, it may be useful to omit the call to WaitForHardware().
