HW/SW Hybrid Project Foundation

This module is the top-level module that represents the root of a HW/SW Hybrid
application using LEAP. As such it is responspible for:

A) Providing the top-level SCons files and python libraries for compilation.
B) Instantiating the LEAP virtual platform.
C) Invoking handling of command-line switches.
D) Instantiating the user application, starting the FPGA, and invoking Main().

This is supported by Project Common, a module representing utilities
commonly useful to all projects.

CommandLine.py              Inteprets build parameters for Scons.
Module.py                   Python class representing an AWB module.
ModuleList.py               Python class representing an AWB APM tree.
ProjectDependency.py        Tracks dependencies.
Utils.py                    Miscellaneous utility functions.

SCons.hw.pipeline.template  SCons invocation of HW build pipeline.
SCons.iface.template        SCons invocation of HW/SW interface build pipeline.
SCons.sw.pipeline.template  SCons invocation of SW build pipeline.
SCons.top.pipeline.template Top-level SCons script.
Makefile.top.template       Empty makefile just invokes SCons.

hardware-done.h             A SW utility for noticing when the FPGA is finished.
project-hybrid-main.bsv     Top-level HW file, instantiates app and platform.
project-hybrid-main.{h,cpp} Top-level SW file, instantiates platform, calls main

project-vico/               Project using ViCo co-simulation.
