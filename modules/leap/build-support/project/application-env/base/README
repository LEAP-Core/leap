Base Hybrid Applications Environment

This represents the "base" application environment - one for applications
that do not need any kind of special support. (IE Soft Services.) Most
Bluespec code that was not coded with AWB/LEAP in mind uses this
environment.  All LEAP FPGA environments now provide soft services.
Non soft services applications employing this environnent are typically
small and used to debug the platform.
