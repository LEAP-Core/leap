LEAP Build Support

This directory contains AWB modules related to the building and synthesizing
of HW/SW hybrid FPGA applications. The modules are organized as follows:

build-pipelines/    Python libraries for arranging SCons into a modular build
                    pipeline for FPGA synthesis.
project/            The top-level module which describes a HW/SW hybrid project,
                    including top-level Pyhton SCons invocation.
