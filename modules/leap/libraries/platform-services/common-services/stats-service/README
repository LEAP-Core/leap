Stats Service

This module wraps the LEAP Stats Virtual Device in Soft Connections.

Soft Connection chains are used so that multiple stats throughout the design
can be connected in an efficient manner. Support is also provided for vectors
of statistics, where the vector size can be dynamically determined.

First, stats are defined using LEAP dictionaries:

def STATS.FETCH.INSTRUCTIONS_FETCHED "Number of instructions fetched.";

Then stats are instantiated using the dictionary entry:

`include "awb/dict/STATS_FETCH.bsh"

let instsFetched <- mkStatsCounter(`STATS_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS_FETCHED);

Finally rules may increment the stat using incr() or incrBy():

rule fetch (True);
    ...
    instsFetched.incr();
    
Vectors of stats are similar, except that they use a parameter to incr(x) to 
indicate that element x of the vector should be incremented.
