Debug Scan Service

This service wraps the Debug Scan Virtual Device in Soft Connections.

Connection Chains are used so that there can be many different modules
connected to the device efficiently.

Sets of values to scan are collected in DEBUG_SCAN_FIELD_LISTs by
adding them with module addDebugScanField.  For example:

    DEBUG_SCAN_FIELD_LIST dbg_list = List::nil;
    dbg_list <- addDebugScanField(dbg_list, "Read state", readState);
    dbg_list <- addDebugScanMaybeField(dbg_list, "Token", tok);
    ...

The list of fields must then be attached to a scan node:

    let dbgNode <- mkDebugScanNode("My module's state", dbg_list);
