Front Panel Service

This module wraps the LEAP Front Panel Virtual Device in Soft Connections.

There is assumed to be one writer of the LEDs, and one reader of the buttons &
switches in the system, so no Connection Chains are used. Instead the following
soft connections are defined:


    Connection_Receive#(FRONTP_MASKED_LEDS) linkLEDs     <- mkConnectionRecvOptional("fpga_leds");
    Connection_Send#(FRONTP_SWITCHES)       linkSwitches <- mkConnectionSendOptional("fpga_switches");
    Connection_Send#(FRONTP_BUTTON_INFO)    linkButtons  <- mkConnectionSendOptional("fpga_buttons");

Modules in the application may define the duals of these connections to access
the device. Since the connections are optional, no error occurs if they
are unused.
