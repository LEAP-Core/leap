Central Cache Service

This service wraps the LEAP Central Cache Virtual Device in Soft Connections.

Because there are assumed to be only a few readers/writers of the cache in the
system, direct point-to-point Soft Connections are used. Two vectors of Soft
Connections are created:


    Vector#(CENTRAL_CACHE_N_CLIENTS, CONNECTION_SERVER#(CENTRAL_CACHE_REQ, CENTRAL_CACHE_RESP)) link_cache = newVector();
    Vector#(CENTRAL_CACHE_N_CLIENTS, CONNECTION_CLIENT#(CENTRAL_CACHE_BACKING_REQ, CENTRAL_CACHE_BACKING_RESP)) link_cache_backing = newVector();

    for (Integer p = 0; p < valueOf(CENTRAL_CACHE_N_CLIENTS); p = p + 1)
    begin
        link_cache[p] <- mkConnectionServerOptional("vdev_cache_" + integerToString(p));

Modules wishing to connect to the central cache can define the duals of these
connections. Note that these connections are optional, so no error results if
a port is unused.

The Central Cache service uses other platform services (Stats, Debug Scan) to
help users track performance data and aid in debugging.
