Central Cache

The central cache module represents a large cache that is implemented using
the Local Memory device abstraction. Lines are read to and from the Local Memory
as efficiently as possible.

Multiple clients can access the same cache, and will be given logically 
independent ports.

A null variant is provided for applications that do not need a HW-only cache.
