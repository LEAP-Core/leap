Standard Shared Memory Virtual Device

This device represents a memory space shared between HW and SW. Coherence
is maintained using RRR. This is built upon the LEAP Remote Memory abstraction
layer.

!!!

This device is a work in progress.

The current code will not compile following the move of the code out of
virtual devices.  The low level platform is no longer visible.  A shim
will need to be added to virtual devices exposing physical shared memory
as soft connections, similar to the way local memory is exposed.
