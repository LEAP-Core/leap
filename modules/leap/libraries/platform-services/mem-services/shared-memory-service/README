Shared Memory Service

This service wraps the LEAP Shared Memory device in Soft Connections. As
this device is under development, this service currently only uses 
point-to-point Soft Connections to allow one user to connect to this device.

A more sophisticated version would use Connection Chains similar to the
Scratchpad Service.
