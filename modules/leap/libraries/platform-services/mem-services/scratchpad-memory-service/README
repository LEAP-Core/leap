Scratchpad Memory Service

This module wraps the LEAP Scratchpad Virtual Device in Soft Connections. 
Connection Chains are used so that many distributed modules can efficiently
connect to the device.

First, an entry for the Scratchpad is defined using LEAP Dictionaries:

def VDEV.SCRATCH.ICACHE_DATA "Scratchpad for storing ICache data.";

Then the Scratchpad is constructed, typcically with mkScratchpad() or 
mkScratchpadMultiRead()

let cacheData <- mkScratchpad(`VDEV_SCRATCH_ICACHE_DATA, SCRATCHPAD_CACHED);


Subdirectories contain varying implementations of scratchpad memory:
  common/     Base typedefs and common definitions.
  hybrid/     HW/SW scratchpad that uses HW local memory backed by SW memory.
  local/      HW scratchpad using local memory only.
