Starter Service

This module wraps the LEAP Starter Virtual Device in Soft Connections.

It is assumed that only one module in the HW system wants to interact with the
Starter Device. Therefore the following point-to-point Soft Connection is
used:


Connection_Receive#(Bit#(8)) linkStarterFinishRun <- mkConnectionRecvOptional("vdev_starter_finish_run");

The connection is optional, so the dual may be omitted without error.
