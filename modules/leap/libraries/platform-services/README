Platform Services

This module is a library that wraps LEAP Virtual Devices with Soft Connections.
This provides a convenience to the user as they no longer need to explicitly
pass the interface to various virtual devices around to the modules. Any
application that wishes to use these services must use the Soft Services 
application environment.

A wrapped version of every virtual device is provided with the following naming
scheme:

FOO_device : FOO_service

For devices which have many "users" defined by dictionaries, Soft Connection 
chains are used to efficiently connect these users to the virtual devices.
This avoids the problem of having an N-to-1 mux/demux around every virtual
device.

For devices that only have a single user (starter, front panel, etc) a point-
to-point optional Soft Connection is defined, so that any module may be the
person that interacts with this device.

As an additional convenience, this module also wraps RRR-generated Clients
and Servers in a version with Soft Connections.

A null version of this module is provided for applications that want Soft
Services but do not want wrapped virtual devices (perhaps because their
FPGA Environment uses the Null Virtual Devices). This version still provides
RRR wrapping.
