Soft Service Soft Connections Algorithm

This module represents the actual instance of the Soft Services typeclass for 
soft connections. This means that this module defines the behavior of Soft
Connections at each synthesis boundary (when dangling connections are exposed
to the leap-connect script using compiler messages) as well as at the top level
(when dangling connections are an error).

Multicasts and shared interconnects are supported, but because leap-connect
does not yet know about them, they are connected at every synthesis boundary
as if it were the top level - IE unmatched connections are errors.
