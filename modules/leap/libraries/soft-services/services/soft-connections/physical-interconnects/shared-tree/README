Shared Tree Physical Interconnect

This module contains the implementation of a physical tree network which can
be shared by many different Soft Connections. Routing tables are constructed
at compilation time using static elaboration.

Many-to-one and One-to-many and Many-to-Many connections are supported.

See [DAC 2009] for an explanation of the routing table algorithm.
