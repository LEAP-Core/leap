Soft Connections (3.0)

This module defines Soft Connections, a communication hierachy that can be
implicitly passed between hardware modules, thus furthering plug-and-play
modularity. Furthermore, it allows the logical communication topology to 
be divorced from the physical communication toplogy.

See [DAC 2008] for a complete description.

alg/                        Algorithm for connecting soft connections together.
physical-interconnects/     Physical interconnect topologies like trees.
