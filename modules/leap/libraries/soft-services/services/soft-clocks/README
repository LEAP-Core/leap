Soft Clocks

The Soft Clocks module allows the user to make a clock that is implicitly
carried around between modules.

In the future it could support naming of different clocks.

The soft_clocks_lib module contains basic typedef info needed to work out 
dependencies correctly with the soft-services sets.
