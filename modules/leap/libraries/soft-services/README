This directory contains organizations of Soft Services. These are hardware
elements that are implicitly available to all hardware modules. Soft Services
remain available past synthesis boundaries through the use of a 
Wrapper/Surrogate system known as Smart Synthesis Boundaries.

Services are defined individually and composed into sets of available services
based on what the application needs.

services/               The individual services themselves.
soft-service-sets/      Combinations of individual services.
util/                   Utility functions and base typedefs.
