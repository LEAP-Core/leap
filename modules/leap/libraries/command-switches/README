Standard Command Switches

This module is a library of classes for processing command-line switches in a 
distributed fashion. Other modules in the system may individually define
command-line switches that they process, and at runtime these switches are
dynamically aggregated into the command line switches for the entire program,
including "--help" usage messages.

One restriction of this model is that modules should ensure their command 
switches are uniquely named.

command-switch-processor.{h,cpp}    The actual processing of command line
                                    and dispatch to distributed handlers.
command-switches.{h,cpp}            Class definitions for user-defined switches.
default-switches.{h,cpp}            Switches that LEAP run.bmark script
                                    expects every application to handle.
