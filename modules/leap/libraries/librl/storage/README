LibRL Storage

Structures for organizing and storing data in reconfigurable logic.

fifo-mem.bsv                        FIFOs in on-chip memory (IE block RAM).
fifo-scoreboard.bsv                 Completion buffers
memory-heap.bsv                     Wrap a RAM in a heap-like allocation structure.
reversal-buffer-bram.bsv            FIFO that reverses block of data (uses BRAM).
reversal-buffer.bsv                 FIFO that reverses block of data (uses registers).
stream-capture-fifo.bsv             Captures streams of data values.
stream-capture-fifo-common.bsv      Support code for capturing streams of data values.
triggered-stream-capture-fifo.bsv   Captures data streams, but only latches 
                                    them on an external trigger.
