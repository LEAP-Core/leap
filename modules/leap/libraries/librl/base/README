LibRL Base

The base functionlity of librl, which is then used to compose more complex
structures.

Modules in this directory may depend only on Bluespec's native packages and
not on any other modules defined in awb.  This restriction makes it possible
for other components in LEAP to use the only the base modules.

bluespec-def.bsv        Useful Bluespec type definitions for aliasing.
counters.bsv            Counters that have useful scheduling parallelism.
counting-filter.bsv     An abstraction of all counting filers, such as Blum.
debug-file.bsv          A better debug alternative to $fdisplay.
extends.bsv             Useful bit extension/truncation without provisos.
fifo-functions.bsv      Represent logical FIFOs in RAM.
fifo-merge.bsv          Efficient implementation of FIFOs with multiple ports.
fifo-peekable.bsv       A FIFO that enables peeking an arbitrary object in the FIFO.  
guarded-pipelines.bsv   Take a synchronous pipeline and wrap it with FIFOS.
hash-bits.bsv           Useful and efficient hashing functions.
lfsr.bsv                LFSR support functions for pseudo-randomness.
local-arbiters.bsv      Arbiters that are suitable for inclusion within a single rule. 
memory-interface.bsv    General interface to bursty multi-cycle memoy.
memory-pack.bsv         Memories of different sizes on fixed physical storage.
register.bsv            Useful functions for transforming registers
