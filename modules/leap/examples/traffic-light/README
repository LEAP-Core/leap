Traffic Light System

This simple application that uses soft connections
to the front panel service to flash the LEDs in
the pattern of the traffic lights at an 
intersection described in the Bluespec tutorial.

All the work is actually done in a submodule of 
this module but through the magic of soft 
connections no wires are explicitly passed through
this module to the submodule. This submodule may or
may optionally be configured as a Smart Synthesis 
Boundary in order to demonstrate this capability.


With only 4 LEDs only a subset of the lights
are displayed.
