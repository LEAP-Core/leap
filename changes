Initial cut at a Leap package, which extracts the non-modeling
components from the HAsim package and copies them here. This 
includes the build tools, non-modeling specific modules and 
submodels and the non-model demo designs. Changes include renaming
the build tools to leap-* from hasim-* and renaming the perl 
library to Leap:: from HAsim::. 

To use the Leap tools/modules one should check out the Leap package
and have a sufficiently new verion of the awb package installed
so that the leap-* tools are defined (in asimstarter). Finally,
the model (.apm file) must use the type 'Leap'.

To ease the transition from the modules in the HAsim package to
those in the Leap package, the modules and submodels continue to 
live in the the same relative (uniondir) directory (this includes 
the use of some hasim/ subdirectories in the Leap pacakge). That 
means that the uniondir mechanism will pick out the files from the
first package in the SEARCHPATH - preferably Leap. Checking out 
Leap after HAsim should result in the correct behavior.

Note further that all the modules and submodels in the Leap package
currently continue to exist in the HAsim package. This means that 
users who checkout HAsim and not Leap should be unaffected by 
changes in the Leap package. Soon, however, use of the HAsim package
without the Leap package will be deprecated as new functionality 
will only be added to the Leap tools and eventually redundant files
in the HAsim package will be deleted.

Migration of hasim commits 826,829,830 by kfleming

Added a more general test for MCD designs on a variety of platforms

A few minor changes:

  1) Added MCD testbench involving a scratchpad
  2) Filled in MCD struct, silencing some (but not all) MCD-related warnings
  3) Added RRR instantiation to Null Services 
       I believe that this is what was meant in the code 
       (given that it already included rrr.bsh)

Migration from hasim of r831 by kfleming

Two sets of modifications - some inexorable groundwork for multifpga
builds (in the sense that I couldn't unedit the files).  However,
these changes are ignored by downstream tools, and do not affect code
paths using the non-pipelined build.  There are some minor changes to
the hasim scripts.  Most of these are generalizations of code which
broke once I started building things from the root of the source tree,
as opposed to intervening nodes.  I also add an option for inserting a
hash into the generated verilog stub files.  This prevents unecessary
rebuilds when the corresponding wrappers change, but do not modify
thier interface.

Fixed bug in python includes - python __init__ is only viewable by
modules outside a package. This meant that the parameters of a package
were visible everywhere _except_ in the package.  We now generate a
config.py, the zen of python recommended practice.  I think it's ugly,
but it's workable.

MCD stage now generates better clock crossing ucf statements.  We also
generate xcf statements which prevent spurious BUFG instantiation, which was preventing larger designs from mapping sucessfully (and maybe also affecting functional correctness).

Fixed some rather obvious bugs that were preventing Altera builds from
completing.  That's all done now and bitfiles get produced.  I can
program the boards, but I suspect that there are some permissions
issues because I can't open nios2-terminal.  Should be fixable.

frequency to XCF files for synthesis boundaries, hopefully improving
synthesis quality.  mcd.tcl now emits a different path to the
oscillator for PLL devices.

In the SCons scripts, coerce commands in the hardware build
to be spawned under bash insteaad of sh. This allows the bsc 
log builder to work, even with the reference to the bash-only
$PIPESTATUS variable.

This eliminates what I believe to be the last reason for
requiring /bin/sh to be a reference to bash instead of dash.
This means that on Ubuntu systems, one doesn't need to
change the /bin/sh symbolic link to point at bash any more.

Moved stuff from platforms to leap:
* librl
* virtual_platform (including rrr, channelio, virtual_devices, llpi)
* fpgaenv APMs
* application_env

Deleted obsolete code:
* old dme/afu stuff

At this stage, no file names or UnionDir paths have been changed. Therefore many references to hasim
continue to exist.

Change benchmark setup/run to be much simpler and not performance-model specific. 
This is a stopgap until we implement our longterm "a.out" plan.

Change "hasim_debug" directory to "leap_debug." Update locations in librl.

Add LLPI pthread workaround temporarily until we can find a better longterm solution.

Resurrected verilog build pipeline (not fully, there are still some
mechanical steps which must be taken, like copying the vpi dynamic
libraries.  I also modified PAR to support xilinx 12 which moved the
placer table command line option to the map stage.

Reworked the bram fifo memory clear to be in main rule.  This has two effects:

1) BRAMFIFO now matches scheduling of Bluespec SizedFIFO exactly
2) Scheduling errors related to clear method are resolved.

* Add a build pipeline project that actually provides "project" instead of 
  "model".
  
* Update SCons pipeline templates to import @ROOT_MODEL@ rather than a 
  hardcoded "model."

* We are now ready to start switching to project at the top level! This will
  be done after the upcoming Leap file rearrangement.

Patch for the models broken by the previous check-in. This patch is
shaky in the sense the it special cases ROOT_DIR_MODEL in the
recursive SW configuration step in leap-configure.  The real solution
to this problem is probably moving the SW recursion into the build
pipeline, but that will take time.

* Major LEAP file reorganization to remove references to HAsim and obsolete file
naming conventions.

* In general, the content of files in this checkin are unchanged, just their
  names and locations on disks. Two exceptions:
  
  A) .awb files have been updated if source file names changed.
  B) .apm files have been updated with the new locations, and upgraded to format
     version 2.2 to facilitate finding moved files.

* Some concessions to backwards compatability has been made by keeping code
  that is obsolete but still supported. These modules are generally placed in
  directories called backwards-compat. Currently these files are planned to be
  removed once code refactoring is done.
  
* fpga-environment.awb was mistakenly left in platforms. Now moved to LEAP.

* Now that AWB better supports changed file locations, we should hopefully do
  these reorganizations incrementally and no longer have to do monster checkins
  on this magnitude.

Reworked memory fifo to use the FIFOCount interface.  We were already
tracking count as part of implementation, but now it can be optionally
exposed to the instantiator.  This was needed for implementing
rudimentary flow control to work around the rrr sw-handle thread's
deadlock issues.  I really wish it had non-blcoking writes.

Added xupv5 serial device.  Since serial is a general device, I reorganized it depend on a platform-specific ucf.  Some more work is needed.  1) we need to ensure a constant 100Mhz clock - this is not an issue for XUPv5 and XUPv2, but other platforms may not have an available 100Mhz oscillator.  2) I need more robust flow control enable/disable as some platforms, including XUPv5, do not support HW flow control.

Added new Synplify/XST hybrid build pipeline stage.  I gave up on an
entirely synplify-based solution -- the ucf files were killing me.
Rather now, we use XST to build the root model and Synplify to build
the synthesis boundaries.  This method is a good comprimise - things
like ucf can be shared and we still get most of the benefit of
synplify.  Using this pipeline, I have produced working bitfiles for
ACP and XUPV5-PCIE.

Also, I fixed a unportable symlink bug.  Python files are now linked
with relative symlinks.

Backported some typeclass instances from soft-service to
soft-connection so that newer codes can still build with the old build
script.  This is part of an effort to debug the bsv-build dependency
issue in the build pipeline, but it's also generally useful.

Fixes two problems in the pipeline build Bluespec stage:

1. Wrapper bo rebuilds need to force stub bo rebuilds
2. Bluespec-style synth boundaries need to force bluesim/verilog rebuilds.

The fix involves adding appropriate dependencies to ensure that these rebuilds occur.

The updated m5 no longer appends python code to the end of the binary.  Instead,
code is stored in statically constructed arrays as the program starts.  The
build rules are thus simpler.

* Reorganization of Soft Services using ModuleContext's built in support for 
  HList. This cleans up the definitions of individual services and removes the 
  need for lifting. Soft services are now defined by two typeclasses:
  SOFT_SERVICE, and SYNTHESIZABLE_SOFT_SERVICE.
  
* This reorganization probably could be taken even farther to remove some of the 
  dependencies in the "soft_services_lib -> soft_conn_lib -> soft_services -> 
  soft_conn -> soft_services_defs" dependence chain. However this is left to a
  future checkin as this revision already changes quite a lot.
  
* Port the "chunking of connections" to the soft service version of soft 
  connections.

* Support for multicast soft connections across synthesis boundaries is now
  included in leap-connect (using the new SOFT_SERVICES typeclasses above).
  
* Optional connections are now supported across synthesis boundaries by
  leap-connect.  

* Support for stations and trees is now enabled, but is not yet supported
  across synthesis boundaries.

* General cleanup and refactoring of Soft Connections code using new
  Dispatcher functions.

* With these changes the build pipeline now works with every known model.

* Change all models in leap to use the "Hybrid HW/SW Pipeline Project". The
  old monolithic SConscipt is still left for backwards compatability for now.
  
* Update all models in leap to use full Soft Services instead of just soft
  connections.

* Remove some references to "bsv-libraries" fork of librl-mit. This seems to be
  harmless.

* Compiling HAsim's alpha_unpipelined_exe model with the build pipeline & soft
  services is currently resulting in an internal compiler error. This
  change will allow regressions to pass until this is resolved.

- WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was an old, partial solution to the configuration in which
  unconnected applications define platform service devices on the software side
  but don't instantiate the hardware side.  WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was the starter
  service.  Dynamic parameters have the same problem.  Applications that use
  software-side dynamic parameters were trying to send them to the hardware
  side and deadlocking.

  Drop WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE.  Instead, add PLATFORM_SERVICES_AVAILABLE to all
  application environments.

- Add a 'synth' build target to all FPGA synthesis SCons rules.  This is
  a convenient target for a single build that will be the basis of multiple
  cost table place and route attempts.

* Code cleanup in preparation for release. This basically means:
** Stricter adherence to coding/indenting conventions.
** Use of `include "asim/provides/foo.bsh" instead of "import foo::*"
** Adding copyright header to every code file.
** Replace older syntax like "Connected_Module" with new version. (Though no
   backwards compatability typedefs have been removed at this time.)

* Remove some empty files.

* Remove some lingering references to hasim (mostly in attributes)

* Remaining TODOs before release:
** Allow "asim/provides" to be replaced with "awb/provides"
** More READMEs and better documentation.

Added a tool for the multifpga parser.  This still needs a function
for invoking it from the build pipeline.  That's coming soon.

- Divided clock Verilog name was computed incorrectly.  (At least for all the
  models I tried.)

- Stop testing that the multiplier and divider match the target frequency
  in basic-clock.bsv.  The multiplier and divider are completely ignored.
  We should stop using explicit multipliers and dividers since we have code
  to compute them given an input and target frequency.

- Update the code for printing clock details for ACP.

Added a new function to retrieve build tree paths for files in
ModulList.  This could probably be a little more parametric.

Also, uppgraded the multi-fpga parser to the point that it can be used
in an apm as part of the multifpga build pipeline.  This pipeline
currently resides in a development repository so as not to pollute the
main line codes.

Extended the multifpga build tool to set up the platform apm in
private directory.  This is a stepping stone on the road to multifpga
compilation.

Turn the streams service into a ring instead of a single soft connection.
Now it supports multiple clients instead of a single writer.
