Initial cut at a Leap package, which extracts the non-modeling
components from the HAsim package and copies them here. This 
includes the build tools, non-modeling specific modules and 
submodels and the non-model demo designs. Changes include renaming
the build tools to leap-* from hasim-* and renaming the perl 
library to Leap:: from HAsim::. 

To use the Leap tools/modules one should check out the Leap package
and have a sufficiently new verion of the awb package installed
so that the leap-* tools are defined (in asimstarter). Finally,
the model (.apm file) must use the type 'Leap'.

To ease the transition from the modules in the HAsim package to
those in the Leap package, the modules and submodels continue to 
live in the the same relative (uniondir) directory (this includes 
the use of some hasim/ subdirectories in the Leap pacakge). That 
means that the uniondir mechanism will pick out the files from the
first package in the SEARCHPATH - preferably Leap. Checking out 
Leap after HAsim should result in the correct behavior.

Note further that all the modules and submodels in the Leap package
currently continue to exist in the HAsim package. This means that 
users who checkout HAsim and not Leap should be unaffected by 
changes in the Leap package. Soon, however, use of the HAsim package
without the Leap package will be deprecated as new functionality 
will only be added to the Leap tools and eventually redundant files
in the HAsim package will be deleted.

Migration of hasim commits 826,829,830 by kfleming

Added a more general test for MCD designs on a variety of platforms

A few minor changes:

  1) Added MCD testbench involving a scratchpad
  2) Filled in MCD struct, silencing some (but not all) MCD-related warnings
  3) Added RRR instantiation to Null Services 
       I believe that this is what was meant in the code 
       (given that it already included rrr.bsh)

Migration from hasim of r831 by kfleming

Two sets of modifications - some inexorable groundwork for multifpga
builds (in the sense that I couldn't unedit the files).  However,
these changes are ignored by downstream tools, and do not affect code
paths using the non-pipelined build.  There are some minor changes to
the hasim scripts.  Most of these are generalizations of code which
broke once I started building things from the root of the source tree,
as opposed to intervening nodes.  I also add an option for inserting a
hash into the generated verilog stub files.  This prevents unecessary
rebuilds when the corresponding wrappers change, but do not modify
thier interface.

Fixed bug in python includes - python __init__ is only viewable by
modules outside a package. This meant that the parameters of a package
were visible everywhere _except_ in the package.  We now generate a
config.py, the zen of python recommended practice.  I think it's ugly,
but it's workable.

MCD stage now generates better clock crossing ucf statements.  We also
generate xcf statements which prevent spurious BUFG instantiation, which was preventing larger designs from mapping sucessfully (and maybe also affecting functional correctness).

Fixed some rather obvious bugs that were preventing Altera builds from
completing.  That's all done now and bitfiles get produced.  I can
program the boards, but I suspect that there are some permissions
issues because I can't open nios2-terminal.  Should be fixable.

frequency to XCF files for synthesis boundaries, hopefully improving
synthesis quality.  mcd.tcl now emits a different path to the
oscillator for PLL devices.

In the SCons scripts, coerce commands in the hardware build
to be spawned under bash insteaad of sh. This allows the bsc 
log builder to work, even with the reference to the bash-only
$PIPESTATUS variable.

This eliminates what I believe to be the last reason for
requiring /bin/sh to be a reference to bash instead of dash.
This means that on Ubuntu systems, one doesn't need to
change the /bin/sh symbolic link to point at bash any more.

Moved stuff from platforms to leap:
* librl
* virtual_platform (including rrr, channelio, virtual_devices, llpi)
* fpgaenv APMs
* application_env

Deleted obsolete code:
* old dme/afu stuff

At this stage, no file names or UnionDir paths have been changed. Therefore many references to hasim
continue to exist.

Change benchmark setup/run to be much simpler and not performance-model specific. 
This is a stopgap until we implement our longterm "a.out" plan.

Change "hasim_debug" directory to "leap_debug." Update locations in librl.

Add LLPI pthread workaround temporarily until we can find a better longterm solution.

Resurrected verilog build pipeline (not fully, there are still some
mechanical steps which must be taken, like copying the vpi dynamic
libraries.  I also modified PAR to support xilinx 12 which moved the
placer table command line option to the map stage.

Reworked the bram fifo memory clear to be in main rule.  This has two effects:

1) BRAMFIFO now matches scheduling of Bluespec SizedFIFO exactly
2) Scheduling errors related to clear method are resolved.

* Add a build pipeline project that actually provides "project" instead of 
  "model".
  
* Update SCons pipeline templates to import @ROOT_MODEL@ rather than a 
  hardcoded "model."

* We are now ready to start switching to project at the top level! This will
  be done after the upcoming Leap file rearrangement.

Patch for the models broken by the previous check-in. This patch is
shaky in the sense the it special cases ROOT_DIR_MODEL in the
recursive SW configuration step in leap-configure.  The real solution
to this problem is probably moving the SW recursion into the build
pipeline, but that will take time.

* Major LEAP file reorganization to remove references to HAsim and obsolete file
naming conventions.

* In general, the content of files in this checkin are unchanged, just their
  names and locations on disks. Two exceptions:
  
  A) .awb files have been updated if source file names changed.
  B) .apm files have been updated with the new locations, and upgraded to format
     version 2.2 to facilitate finding moved files.

* Some concessions to backwards compatability has been made by keeping code
  that is obsolete but still supported. These modules are generally placed in
  directories called backwards-compat. Currently these files are planned to be
  removed once code refactoring is done.
  
* fpga-environment.awb was mistakenly left in platforms. Now moved to LEAP.

* Now that AWB better supports changed file locations, we should hopefully do
  these reorganizations incrementally and no longer have to do monster checkins
  on this magnitude.

Reworked memory fifo to use the FIFOCount interface.  We were already
tracking count as part of implementation, but now it can be optionally
exposed to the instantiator.  This was needed for implementing
rudimentary flow control to work around the rrr sw-handle thread's
deadlock issues.  I really wish it had non-blcoking writes.

Added xupv5 serial device.  Since serial is a general device, I reorganized it depend on a platform-specific ucf.  Some more work is needed.  1) we need to ensure a constant 100Mhz clock - this is not an issue for XUPv5 and XUPv2, but other platforms may not have an available 100Mhz oscillator.  2) I need more robust flow control enable/disable as some platforms, including XUPv5, do not support HW flow control.

Added new Synplify/XST hybrid build pipeline stage.  I gave up on an
entirely synplify-based solution -- the ucf files were killing me.
Rather now, we use XST to build the root model and Synplify to build
the synthesis boundaries.  This method is a good comprimise - things
like ucf can be shared and we still get most of the benefit of
synplify.  Using this pipeline, I have produced working bitfiles for
ACP and XUPV5-PCIE.

Also, I fixed a unportable symlink bug.  Python files are now linked
with relative symlinks.

Backported some typeclass instances from soft-service to
soft-connection so that newer codes can still build with the old build
script.  This is part of an effort to debug the bsv-build dependency
issue in the build pipeline, but it's also generally useful.

Fixes two problems in the pipeline build Bluespec stage:

1. Wrapper bo rebuilds need to force stub bo rebuilds
2. Bluespec-style synth boundaries need to force bluesim/verilog rebuilds.

The fix involves adding appropriate dependencies to ensure that these rebuilds occur.

The updated m5 no longer appends python code to the end of the binary.  Instead,
code is stored in statically constructed arrays as the program starts.  The
build rules are thus simpler.

* Reorganization of Soft Services using ModuleContext's built in support for 
  HList. This cleans up the definitions of individual services and removes the 
  need for lifting. Soft services are now defined by two typeclasses:
  SOFT_SERVICE, and SYNTHESIZABLE_SOFT_SERVICE.
  
* This reorganization probably could be taken even farther to remove some of the 
  dependencies in the "soft_services_lib -> soft_conn_lib -> soft_services -> 
  soft_conn -> soft_services_defs" dependence chain. However this is left to a
  future checkin as this revision already changes quite a lot.
  
* Port the "chunking of connections" to the soft service version of soft 
  connections.

* Support for multicast soft connections across synthesis boundaries is now
  included in leap-connect (using the new SOFT_SERVICES typeclasses above).
  
* Optional connections are now supported across synthesis boundaries by
  leap-connect.  

* Support for stations and trees is now enabled, but is not yet supported
  across synthesis boundaries.

* General cleanup and refactoring of Soft Connections code using new
  Dispatcher functions.

* With these changes the build pipeline now works with every known model.

* Change all models in leap to use the "Hybrid HW/SW Pipeline Project". The
  old monolithic SConscipt is still left for backwards compatability for now.
  
* Update all models in leap to use full Soft Services instead of just soft
  connections.

* Remove some references to "bsv-libraries" fork of librl-mit. This seems to be
  harmless.

* Compiling HAsim's alpha_unpipelined_exe model with the build pipeline & soft
  services is currently resulting in an internal compiler error. This
  change will allow regressions to pass until this is resolved.

- WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was an old, partial solution to the configuration in which
  unconnected applications define platform service devices on the software side
  but don't instantiate the hardware side.  WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was the starter
  service.  Dynamic parameters have the same problem.  Applications that use
  software-side dynamic parameters were trying to send them to the hardware
  side and deadlocking.

  Drop WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE.  Instead, add PLATFORM_SERVICES_AVAILABLE to all
  application environments.

- Add a 'synth' build target to all FPGA synthesis SCons rules.  This is
  a convenient target for a single build that will be the basis of multiple
  cost table place and route attempts.

* Code cleanup in preparation for release. This basically means:
** Stricter adherence to coding/indenting conventions.
** Use of `include "asim/provides/foo.bsh" instead of "import foo::*"
** Adding copyright header to every code file.
** Replace older syntax like "Connected_Module" with new version. (Though no
   backwards compatability typedefs have been removed at this time.)

* Remove some empty files.

* Remove some lingering references to hasim (mostly in attributes)

* Remaining TODOs before release:
** Allow "asim/provides" to be replaced with "awb/provides"
** More READMEs and better documentation.

Added a tool for the multifpga parser.  This still needs a function
for invoking it from the build pipeline.  That's coming soon.

- Divided clock Verilog name was computed incorrectly.  (At least for all the
  models I tried.)

- Stop testing that the multiplier and divider match the target frequency
  in basic-clock.bsv.  The multiplier and divider are completely ignored.
  We should stop using explicit multipliers and dividers since we have code
  to compute them given an input and target frequency.

- Update the code for printing clock details for ACP.

Added a new function to retrieve build tree paths for files in
ModulList.  This could probably be a little more parametric.

Also, uppgraded the multi-fpga parser to the point that it can be used
in an apm as part of the multifpga build pipeline.  This pipeline
currently resides in a development repository so as not to pollute the
main line codes.

Extended the multifpga build tool to set up the platform apm in
private directory.  This is a stepping stone on the road to multifpga
compilation.

Turn the streams service into a ring instead of a single soft connection.
Now it supports multiple clients instead of a single writer.

Added an awb for multifpga soft connections. We need an extra
parameter and a couple of extra files.  I am creating a second awb to
avoid putting switches in the baseline code.

- Consolidate SCons debug printing in a single method (getBuildPipelineDebug)
  that allows requesting debug printing either on the SCons command line
  or by an AWB parameter.
- Debug parameter (BUILD_PIPELINE_DEBUG) is an integer.  The higher the number,
  the more detail may be emitted.
- Make the Verilog simulation build work:
  - Break out Bluespec Verilog libraries into a separate dependency group.
  - getAllDependencies now returns a unique list.
- Bluesim build now can build a Verilog simulator target instead using
  the SCons "vexe" target.  This is most often useful for switching to
  waveform debugging to match the generated .v file variable names.

- Remove cost table argument for par.  New Xilinx tools don't allow it.
- Add Bluespec-supplied XCF file to build pipeline.  Bluespec should do
  a better job providing a base template.  For now, we just use the
  XUPV5 version since templates for all current boards are identical.

* Fix a bug where models that did not have soft connections were not invoking
  the starter device correctly.
  
* Add a method called WaitForHardware() to the starter device. This mimics
  the functionality of the old WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE parameter in a much more
  flexible way.

* Change hello-world to use WaitForHardware().

* Note: due to a buffering issue in our run.pl script "Hello World" is sometimes
  not printed until after the application exits. This should be fixable by
  having the run.pl script wait for its forked child to exit. Direct command-
  line execution works perfectly. We should think about what the 
  "correct solution" for the IO buffering problem is....

* Replace #include "asim/provides/FOO.h" with "awb/provides/FOO.h"

* Build directories contain appropriate symlinks from "asim" to "awb" so
  existing code doesn't break.

* Update all files in Leap to the new convention.

* Ensure all #includes are using the correct convention.

Build pipeline changes for synthesis:

- Set the working directory properly during BSV (needed by Synplify)
- Set the source files correctly for ngdbuild
- Support multiple XCF files
- Fix Synplify (with Xst top level) build.
- Still broken:  Synplify does not work in parallel due to file conflicts.

- Change default ring data width to 128 bits instead of 320.  This was the
  default with the old system.

Finally, the build process appears to be stable with the new Bluespec compiler.

- Merged the Xst build pipeline controllers into a single module, controlled
  by an awb parameter.  They differed by only a single line, either running
  Bluespec's basicinout on the top level Verilog or not.
- Add an Xst command to treat Verilog case statements as parallel.  It is
  enabled by default, but can be turned off with an awb parameter.

- Bluespec now requires that an XCF file be applied to Xst builds in order to
  get correct results.  Unfortunately, there are Xst bugs triggered by the
  Bluespec default version.  (The usual Xst mishandling of RegFile storage.)
  Our LUTRAM implementation works around all known bugs, but the Bluespec
  XCF file interferes.

  I thought about modifying the XCF file in the Bluespec compiler's directory,
  but concluded that was a bad idea since every user would have to fix his
  own Bluespec installation.  Instead, I added bluespec.xcf here.  If the file
  ever becomes compiler-version specific we can manage that in the build
  pipeline.

So far, these rules have been tested with ISE version 11.5.

* Add over 100 README files. Each directory has a README file. Currently the
  quality of the README file varies based on the importance of the module and
  my understanding of its operation. Priority is given to "application-facing"
  APIs like Stats, Params, RRR, etc. Still, there is obviously room to improve
  many of these. I will be bothering original authors for contributions.
  
* Mark over 60 files as deprecated. These files will not make it into the next
  LEAP release. To find which files are deprecated "grep -r DEPRECATED *". If
  a directory contains a file named DEPRECATED in place of a README then the 
  entire directory is deprecated.

* A few files whose deprecated status is still under investigation are marked
  "DEPRECATED?" in their associated README files.

* No deprecated files are actually deleted in this release, but there 
  is some reorganization:
  ** Physical channel directories, especially pcie.
  ** Command-line switches is now in libraries/
  ** Platform services is now in libraries/
  ** Clean up some misc. file name conventions.
  
* There were two copies of the Streams device. Delete the extraneous one.

* Rename some ViCo modules to the more general "Hardware-Only" name, since
  they can be used with any platform that does not require a software component.

* Rename ViCo Physical Channel to "Passthrough" since it can be used for 
  any physical device that exposes UMF FIFOs.

* Add some copyright notices to misc. files.

* Update .awb files with new READMEs as %notes.

* Update .apm files so they are not stale.

* Next steps: create a branch which is a "release candidate" and does not
  contain deprecated files. This will give people an opportunity to complain
  if something was wrongly marked as deprecated.

* List of files whose deprecated status is under investigation. These are all
  related to soft services dependencies....

since the timing is unlikely.

 tool.py                   Locally Modified          153 

- Build sub-models in multi_fpga subdirectory of parent instead of in root.
- Build rule for sub-models generates a result other than the direct result
  of the sub model build.  The old code forced a rebuild of the top level BSV
  every time, even if it was built already.
- Return status of sub-model builds so parent SCons aborts correctly.

 XILINX_XST.py             Locally Modified          154 

Revert to previous version, where child xcf has the same contents as the top level.
Right now, the "top level" file has configuration for all synthesis boundaries.
It also has critical bluespec.xcf configuration.  Without these, builds below
top level are bound to have problems.

The real solution is more complicated and requires some notion of global vs.
local xcf configuration.

Xst was putting SyncFIFO buffers in BRAM!  Not only is this wasteful, it imposes
a more difficult timing on a structure we are forced to tag TIG.

mkSizedBRAMFIFO() now takes the size of the FIFO as an integer parameter instead
of a NumTypeParam#() hack.  The code internally is ugly (taken from the new
Bluespec-supplied version) since there is no good way to convert an integer
value to a type.  However, the interface now matches mkSizedFIFO() and is easier
to use.

- Enable multiprocessor mode in Xilinx map.

- Generate an error if the packed memory in-flight limit is greater than the
  scratchpad in-flight limit.

- Add buffering to the 1-to-many packed memory case since the underlying
  scratchpad ROBs are too small to support multiple reads from a single port.
  The code could be smarter and compute the mimimum extra buffering needed.
  I'll fix that, later.

- Use SCons "Copy" factory instead of "cp" because SCons stores the signature of
  the program in the build dependence.  If "cp" is a different binary it looks like
  rebuilding is needed.

  Removed mkdir from the rules instead of using "Mkdir" factory, since the
  directories appear to be present already and the factory version fails if
  the target exists.

- Clean up after others.  It didn't take long to make the Xilinx loader
  replacement of leap-xilinx-summary look good instead of an ugly hack.

- Restructure the memory packing code to be more efficient.  The old code was
  generated between a client requesting some number of read ports and an
  existing memory with the same number of read ports.  The new code takes
  a function that constructs the underlying memory.  The memory packer adds
  extra read ports to the underlying storage to satisfy the needs of the client
  and the needs of the memory packer.  As a result:

  - Read response buffering is no longer required.
  - The code is simpler.

- The 1:many packing case (multiple underlying buckets for a single client
  entry) no longer allocates a power of two container buckets.  Storage is thus
  used more efficiently.

- Tweak the allocation of ROB slots in the scratchpad code.  ROB slots are now
  allocated in the read request methods.  This avoids a deadlock case in
  which the client couldn't detect an impending deadlock due to a ROB filling
  in an internal rule.

- Removed the multi-cached scratchpad code with Elliott's consent.  It was
  no longer in active use and needs to be rethought:

  - The old code let clients specify different caches for each read port.  The
    client was forced to make assumptions about the way the memory packer
    was going to use read ports.

  - With the change in memory packing it would probably be a better idea
    to define a shim that inserts caches between individual read ports and
    a client for any instance of a multi-ported memory interface.

Elliott realized that most of the traffic in a HAsim multi-FPGA configuration
is from passing an empty token back and forth in the global scratchpad ring.
This is not a good use of the interconnect (duh), especially since traffic is
infrequent enough on that ring that no arbitration is needed.

 - Generalize the token ring and interface into an addressable ring.
 - Add a mkConnectionAddrRingNode() with the same addressable properties
   as the token ring but no token.  When a node has data it sends a message.

phase.  Airblue trips some of these cases with its rrr usage.  It's a

Move soft services and platform services into the FPGA environment.  All
LEAP applications now provide soft connections.

Aside from simplifying the application environment by reducing the number
of varients, this move permits code within the virtual platform to use
soft connections.  It used to be necessary to have platform services expose
soft connections to underlying virtual platform services.  Now a platform
service may implement the service fully.

- Expose local memory as soft connections in the virtual devices.

- Connect to local memory in the central cache through the soft connections.

- Revert to a bypass FIFO on local memory read response in the central cache
  to save a cycle.

  I had switched to a latency one FIFO because it made a bug that we had not yet
  diagnosed go away with multiple lanes in multi-FPGA.  The source of the bug
  has since been identified (compiling with different options in the two
  multi-FPGA passes).

- Move all scratchpad support to platform services.  The scratchpad code
  is now removed from virtual devices.

- Take advantage of soft connections within the scratchpad implementation:

  - The memory connector is now chosen as part of the configuration and is
    implemented below the scratchpad.

  - For hybrid connectors, the code now automatically instantiates the
    connector appropriate to the platform.  For single FPGA systems a simple
    RRR connector is allocated.  For multi-FPGA systems, FPGA 0 gets an RRR
    connector and a ring stop for forwarding remote requests to RRR.  All
    other FPGAs get just a ring stop for sending requests to FPGA 0.
    This eliminates separate AWB configurations and sources for the 3 cases.

  running that release, yet.  Put a version of relpath in Utils.py.

- Remove scratchpad include from NULL std virtual devices.  Scratchpad code
  is now in the platform services.

  Will deal with renaming NULL devices to something more meaningful later.

Move central cache implementation to platform services.  Now that the
implementation is in a domain that accepts soft connections, moved statistics
and deadlock debug dump code local to the code that uses it.

The NULL central cache implementation continues to route incoming requests
directly to the backing storage so clients of the NULL central cache see
exactly the same semantics as a real cache, differing only in timing.

Move shared memory, the last of the memory components, from virtual devices
to the platform services.  As shared memory is a work in progress only
the NULL version "works."  The hybrid version needs a virtual device shim
to map the llpi shared memory to soft connections.

When there is no local memory a central cache will always miss. The synthesis
tools can't detect that most of the cache could be optimized away.  In this case,
don't bother instantiating a real set associative cache.  Instead, route requests
directly to the backing storage.

Memory services in the platform may now be compiled as a separate synthesis
boundary.  All that is needed is a "%param SYNTH_BOUNDARY mkMemServices" in
the AWB file.

It can't be turned on yet because there is no syntax in the multi-FPGA
code to describe synthesis regions that belong on all FPGAs.

Add a global string table, managed by module context, as part of soft services.
The string table generates integer UIDs (currently 32 bits) for a given string.
Note: while UIDs are unique, there may be more than one UID mapped to a given
string.

To allocate a string, a module must be a member of the COLLECTED_MODULE context.
Allocate an entry with:
    GLOBAL_STRING_UID str <- getGlobalStringUID("foo");
getGlobalStringUID() looks for the string in the table.  If present, it returns
the existing UID.  If not present, a new UID is allocated and returned.

The global string table is built as a single database during compilation.
The database is loaded at run time by passing the path in the "-global-strings"
argument.  The standard workload run scripts do this automatically.

Both the synthesis boundary ID and the platform ID are components of a
string's UID, allowing for parallel allocation of global string UIDs during
compilation.

Dump the state of every soft connection sender's notFull and notEmpty bits on the
DEBUG_SCAN ring.  The cost is sufficiently low that this feature is on by default,
though it can be disabled by setting CON_DEBUG_ENABLE to 0 in connections-debug.awb.

The debugging code does add some mapping pressure, since all the notFull/notEmpty
wires within a synthesis boundary must route to the same, local, debug scan node.

- Change the interface to the LibRL marshaller/demarshaller to take the
  marshalled type and the unmarshalled type instead of the marshalled type
  and a vector of the marshalled type.  The internal logic now computes the
  vector length.

- Rename the RRR marshaller to avoid name conflicts with LibRL.  The RRR
  marshaller and demarshaller are incompatible with each other (they send
  different byte orders), so are good to avoid for other purposes.

- Use LibRL marshaller in debug scan.

- Improve C++ debug scan receiver to grow its buffer automatically if a large
  scan record arrives.

Enhanced leap-configure to pick up its options using the
standard awb workspace configuration files (awb.config,
~/.asim/asimrc and <prefix>/etc/asim/asimrc. Invoke the
following to see the options:

   % leap-configure options

Also converted leap-configure to take action commands, such
as 'configure' and 'run' rather than actions switches, such
as -configure and -run, to make it consistent with the other
configuration programs, such as amc(1). The old form still
works and is used by the Perl library, which needs to get
upgraded. But the prefered use of leap-configure is now:

   % leap-configure configure --model=config/pm/.../foo.apm

Also made leap-configure exit more gracefully in the face of 
bad model parameters and added documentation accessable with:

   % leap-configure help

Finally, made bluesim builds work across differnt versions
of gcc due to difference is the availability of the 
no-var-tracking-assignments option. This is accomplished by a
new utility function getGccVersion(). This closes bug #100.

Debug scanning now uses global strings instead of dictionary entries.  Clients
may define fields within a scan record that are parsed and printed in
human-readable form in the software.  There is no hardware overhead for the
parsing, since the formatting descriptor is stored in the global string table.

Functions are provided in the debug scan service for constructing descriptors.

- Skeleton of STDIO service, including support for printf.
  - Client instantiates a STDIO node configured for either 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit
    operation.  (To use %s in printf only 32 and 64 bit are supported.)
  - Passing %s in the format string works.  The software side detects string
    references and converts global string argument UIDs to string pointers.

- Switch to STDIO instead of STREAMS in the hello world example.

- Addressable rings can now self configure, assigning node IDs dyamically.

- Support newline in global strings.

- Add sync() request/response to the STDIO interface, enabling a guarantee
  that all operations are complete.

- Add fprintf().  There isn't a way to open a file yet, so only STDOUT (0)
  and STDERR (2) are supported.  File handles on the hardware side are 8-bit
  indices into a table managed by software.

- Restructure software STDIO request processing so header processing is
  centralized.

- Use sync() in hello world so output is printed before the program exits.

- Add more standard I/O services:
    fclose
    fflush
    fopen
    sprintf

- Add simple run-time allocation of global strings.  There is code to deallocate
  a string to release memory but currently the table only allows one trip
  through the ID space (currently 2^26 entries).

Added an FPGA environment with no services and no virtual devices. A
variety of 'null' varients of services were updated (mostly by creating
empty modules that satisfied the required interfaces) to make this
work.

- Statistics start "off" by default and are enabled by software once the system
  is initialized.

- Validate that RRR works before starting a debug scan in case the debug scan
  chain is deadlocked.  We can then point fingers more accurately.

Move all remaining common virtual devices to their corresponding services and
switch to using soft connections.  The virtual platform is no longer passed
to the common services.

This is the first step toward moving common platform services to their own
synthesis boundary.

- Put common services in a separate synthesis boundary.

- Tweak synthesis dependence computation in Bluespec build rules.  The old code
  copied each synthesis boundary wrapper to all other boundaries, which lead
  to problems when two modules of the same name wound up referenced in a
  compilation.  The new, simpler, scheme adds remote references to synthesis
  boundary wrappers without copying any files.

Restructure the debug scan pipeline slightly so that the master FPGA is on a
private ring.  The hardware side scanner first scans the master ring and then
scans a global ring of all slave FPGAs.  In theory this will give us dumps on
the master even when some inter-FPGA router is deadlocked.

Usually in the multiFPGA router synthesis, we try to be as efficient
as possible in terms of the number of bits transported.  However, in
the case that we generate stats instrumentation, the way that we
calculate these bitwidth can be wrong, and lead to wrong programs.  We
have a plan to fix the caclulation issue, but until we do, I will for
chains to have the maximum bitwidth.

- Statistics now use global strings to describe a node and counters instead of
  dictionaries.  There are serveral advantages:

  - Easier to define statistics.
  - Lower overhead in the FPGA-side code since more static properties of the
    node can be communicated in the global string.
  - Statistics ring message size is now constant.  It used to vary with the
    number of STATS dictionary entries, making multi-FPGA building complicated.

- Add a new RAM vector statistics class, suitable for implementing the
  multiplexed statistics for HAsim.  The "vector" statistic version uses
  a vector of registers, allowing all counters to be updated in a single FPGA
  cycle.  The RAM version uses denser storage with the compromise that only
  one counter may be updated per FPGA cycle.

- Revert the change to connection-implementation.bsv that was added to make
  ring data sizes constant.  This was only needed by multi-FPGA code because
  the statistics data size was not constant.

- Clean up implementations of statistics nodes to reduce complexity.

- Add non-blocking versions of the increment methods.  These are needed
  for I/O modules that also keep statistics where the code may deadlock
  if a counter can't be updated (e.g. the multi-FPGA router).  Instead
  of blocking counter updates may be dropped.  Dropping is only a factor
  when counters are overflowing, which can be controlled by making the
  counter sizes sufficiently large.  The current default counter is 28
  bits.

- Regarding the comment from the last check-in that the new marshaller was too
  large: that is not the case.  In spite of removing all dead transmission cycles
  the new marshaller takes about the same space.  However, I introduced a bug
  a few versions back that coded the marshaller's notEmpty logic incorrectly,
  causing anything calling both deq() and notEmpty() never to fire.
  This resulted in dead code (mostly the debug scan), which was dropped
  during synthesis.  Fixing the bug caused code growth.

- Change the outbound marshaller/demarshaller FIFOs to LFIFOs to save space.
  There are unlikely to be scheduling loops through them.  If it turns out
  to be a problem we can revert to standard FIFOs.

Added a new physical connection type.  Internally, some modules of the
multifpga router need to know if it is safe to schedule an access to
the shared router buffer.  To do this, they need to track buffer
availability.  As a result, they need to see dequeue operations from
the soft connection components.  This check in adds the necessary
visibility.  Existing SC implementations will see the original SC
interface.

- Add a side-buffer to the direct mapped cache to store requests to lines that
  are currently busy, allowing later requests to non-busy lines to go first.
  The side-buffer is light weight (just a FIFO) and it shares filtering logic
  with the new request queue, using a counter as an arbiter to determine which
  FIFO is considered each cycle.

- Grow the side buffer in the set associative cache (used by the central cache)
  to allow more busy references in flight.

- Add an error message to a counting filter when the filter array is larger
  than the index space.  None of our code actually triggered it, but I noticed
  the case and it seemed like the right thing to do.

Take advantage of the Python code running with SCons in the build manager
and permit overriding of AWB parameters as arguments to SCons.  Overridden
parameters are stored in compile-time generated .bsh and .h files that
update the values set by leap-configure.  The Python code doesn't yet
have enough information to simply replace the original leap-generated
parameter include files.

AWB parameters are now stored along with the module name within the Python
code and are no longer seen as global variables.  Modules no longer import
their local "config.py".  Instead, they query a ModuleList method.

The end result is it is now trivial to build a model with a new FPGA
frequency, without having to make permanent changes to configuration files:

    scons MODEL_CLOCK_FREQ=100

Replace our topological build with a build of all synthesis boundaries in parallel
followed by a final "link" step in which all boundaries are included by the
top level model build.

In the old scheme each synthesis boundary built a wrapper module that was
the true boundary compilation and a stub module that included the exposed
wires from the boundary.  The parent was required to instantiate the stub.

The new scheme is similar.  There is still a wrapper with the true compilation
and a stub.  However, the stub is instantiated by the top level module
automatically by the build manager.  A dummy stub module that does nothing
is created by the build manager for two purposes:  compatibility with the
old scheme and so that parent modules may continue to act as though they
instantiate subordinate modules.  This also allows for writing code that will
work unchanged for declaring a module a synthesis boundary or not a boundary.

- BSV.py now creates the synthesis boundary stub in as <module_name>_synth.bsv
  instead of <module_name.bsv.  Also fixed a bug related to multiple targets
  in the top-level model build.

- Move management of multi-FPGA FPGA assignment from the wrapper gen code
  in the multi-FPGA library to standard Module.py.  Modules are now decorated
  with FPGA assignment in the Python SCons code.

- wrapper_gen.py instantiates all synthesis boundaries in a special module
  (instantiateAllSynthBoundaries).  The top level Bluespec model must instantiate
  this module because it must be done within the soft connections context.

- leap-connect now understands the new synthesis boundary compilation names and
  how to create dummy stubs.

- Synthesis boundary Xst builds no longer need to include any other Verilog
  stub files.  I believe the only thing keeping synthesis boundary Xst
  builds from starting immediately after a boundary is compiled is the
  MCD pipeline stage.  The MCD stage forces all Xst builds to wait for
  the top-level model compilation.

- Fix SCons warning about BuildDir.

Counting filters used by the libRL cache implementations were taking a
surprisingly large area.

Counting filter:
  - Change the interface to test/set methods so the test can be used as
    a predicate to a rule.  The old interface combined the two as a single
    actionvalue method.
  - Pass an opaque message from test to set to avoid recomputing state
    required by both methods.
  - Using an opaque type required significant reworking of the static logic
    that picked either a Bloom or decode filter depending on the size of
    the set.
  - Reimplemented decode filter as a pair of LUTRAMs.  One RAM is updated
    by set() and the other by remove().  The restructuring doubles the
    storage but requires only one write port for each of set() and remove().
    The old code required fan out of set/remove requests to logic combining
    requests at every bit.
  - Simplified Bloom filter.
  - Moved to librl/storage since LUTRAM is now required.

Extends:
  Add sameSizeNP to the no-proviso family of truncate/extend functions.
  sameSizeNP asserts that the returned type is the same size as the
  input type for situations where the compiler fails to convince itself
  without provisos.

Type logic operators in bluespec-def:
  The counting filter requires calculation of the size of a type as a function
  of polymorphic numeric type parameters.  A general library now supports this,
  adding: TBool, TNot, TAnd, Tor, TGT, TGE, TNE, TEq, and TSelect.

Direct mapped cache:
  - Simplify the rule set that picks the next request using the counting
    filter test() to decide whether to fire a rule.
  - When address hashing is enabled compute the hash only once and pass it
    through the pipeline.

Set associative cache:
  - Copy the logic from the direct cache for picking either a new request
    or a side request to process.  The old code tried both in parallel, which
    is optimal for time but doubles the already large bloom filter test.

Realized that the Bloom filter's counters don't have to be shared by all
hashes.  Using separate storage for counters associated with each hash
both has fewer false positives and can be implemented using LUTRAMs
instead of a large array of small adders and inefficient storage.

Use 64 bit values in RRR methods.  For 64 bit I/O this reduces the RRR traffic
by about 50%.  FPGA-side STDIO ring traffic is unchanged (32 bits), though RRR
is likely the rate-limiting component.

- Add a Compress typeclass that specifies two modules: one to compress a stream
  and the other to decompress it.

  - Both modules have FIFO-like interfaces, though the input and output types
    of each module are different.

  - A compressor describes the likely breakdown of compressed sizes.  A
    typeclass is provided to walk the description and recursively build
    connections of appropriate sizes.  A soft-connection implementation is
    provided.

  - Connected versions of the typeclass also exist (CompressMC)

  - A sample implementation of Maybe#() compression is provided that transmits
    the payload only when it is valid.

  - A sample marshaller/demarshaller is provided for use with compressors.

- Add a demarshaller that accepts variable sized messages.

- Simplify the Compress typeclass by using the encoded type to describe the
  chunking of the output data.  Removed the mapping parameter.  The encoded
  type can now be an HList of types which, in theory, compose more easily
  with secondary compressors.

- Take advantage of new HList Bits and HLast classes (see below) to manage
  the encoded types.

- Add HList instances that should have been in the Bluespec distribution
  to bluespec-def.bsv:

  * Instance of Bits for HLists
  * HLast/hLast for finding the last non-nil member of an HList.

The expected compressed output type of a Compress typeclass is now a tagged
union, making it easier for the multi-FPGA compiler to manage channel
mapping.  For channel mapping within Bluespec, a new CompressionChunks
typeclass is now available for converting a tagged union to an HList of
chunks.  The existing CompressionMapping typeclass can then map the chunks
to I/O channels.

The old ShowSwitch interface, used when --help was on the command line, was
too gross to be allowed to persist.  Switch from copying text into a buffer
of indetermine size to passing an ostream and writing the message to the
stream.

The argument parsing mechanism is still to complicated.

Prepare leap package for using perlqt4 with conditional build
of leap-front-panel-qt3 or leap-front-panel (currently empty).
Control of build if provided with a --enable-perlqt4 switch
to ./configure. Default for that switch is 'no', but is 
automatically turned to yes for Ubuntu Oneiric and later.

Also removed build dependence on libperl-qt for debian package
builds, because libperl-qt is for qt3 and the package name
is different on qt4, and there is no way to choose a build
dependence conditionally.

- Use MAF structures for scratchpad requests when appropriate instead of
  sending wide data all the way through the memory subsystem.  The read request
  metadata passed around is reduced from the previous maximum of 64 bits
  to 12, for now.

- Eliminate metadata from cache write interfaces.  They made no sense since
  spills are generated inside caches and there is no required correlation between
  the metadata from a request causing a spill and the spilled data.

- Rename cache REF_INFO structures to READ_META to make it a little clearer
  what is being passed around.  I spent a long time trying to guarantee that
  READ_META was actually a UID when passed to caches that could be used for
  indexing a MAF.  This proved extremely difficult to do well as requests
  merge down the cache hierarchy, particularly because the metadata types
  are not all the same.  It would also not have provided much benefit, since
  the only code currently needing to index a MAF is at the top of the hierarchy,
  closest to the client.

  - type make doc inside the package dir to generate documentation. 
  - documentation gets generated inside leap/docs/dox
- bsv.filter script that exists inside awb package is used to convert Bluespec code/comments into Java style code/comments parsed natively by doxygen. 
TODO:
- Doxygen seg faults if doxylayout.xml is used 
- Currently the filter was tested only with a few *.bsv files. Further filtering of comments is required when the filter is used to generate documentation for the entire repository

Add new memory interface mappers that present a multi-read port interface
to the client but maintain storage within a memory having a single read port.
There are two versions.  One maintains strict read/write ordering relative to
the times at which requests arrive.  The other triggers writes immediately.
The latter is more efficient as long as the client can deal with the
unpredictability.

Use a LUTRAM for storing scoreboard FIFO data instead of a vector of registers.
I have no idea why we didn't do this in the first place.

- New ML605 no-memory FPGA environment for quick compilations.  No-memory
  still has the DDR controller but has a NULL local memory and no central
  cache.

- Update BlueNoC physical channel for new driver implementation in platforms.
  The current version has poor performance.  It assumes 8 byte beats and
  4 byte UMF chunks.  Each UMF chunk is sent in a single BlueNoC beat as a
  BlueNoC packet with a 4 byte payload.  The "don't wait" bit is set, forcing
  8 byte messages.  With the UMF to BlueNoC marshaller now in Channel-I/O it
  will be easier to take on the next step of generating more efficient streams.

- Add $BLUESPECDIR/Libraries to the Verilog file search path.  BlueNoC
  components are found there.

- Fix a startup bug in BlueNoC channel I/O in which early messages from FPGA
  to host were lost during reset.

- Add a check for power of 2 boolean typedef to libRL.

- Rewrite the local memory code.  It can now map virtually any DDR memory
  topology to a requested line and word size.  The number of banks, DDR memory
  word size, beat width and number of beats per burst can all be varied
  independently.  All must be powers of 2.

  Two implementations are provided:  one for when the burst size is larger
  than or equal to the size of local memory lines.  The other for when the
  burst is smaller than local memory lines.  The former maps multiple local
  memory lines into a single burst.  The latter spreads a local memory line
  across multiple bursts.  It is the responsibility of the user to select
  the correct implementation in AWB, though it is quite obvious when the
  wrong version is chosen as the wrong one will fail some size and proviso
  checks.

Improved BlueNoC channel I/O performance.  ML605 throughput on RRR test was under
1 MB/s and is now 280 MB/s host->FPGA and 40 MB/s bidirectional test.  Host->FPGA
is approaching theoretical peak where packets are dropped with no host processing
(360 MB/s, based on --pcie-tests.)  Multithreaded I/O management and larger chunks
will be needed to get any more performance.

The main improvements were:
 - Switch from 4 to 8 byte UMF chunks
 - Stop setting "don't wait" bit on every BlueNoC packet.
 - Add a host-side buffer management layer and pass large buffers to the read()
   method.

- Fix a timing bug during initialization.  The initDone signal was passed from the PCIe
  clock domain to the model domain using just a null crossing wire.  When an FPGA->host
  packet was ready and waiting for initDone, permission to write to the sync FIFO was
  not aligned to the sending clock.  There was thus some probability of corruption in
  the first packet sent to the sync FIFO due to hold time violations.  Fixed by holding
  the model-side initDone_Model signal in a register.

- Add a mode in which the FPGA will only send a BlueNoC packet to the host if it can
  be proven that the full packet is data ready.  This prevents the host kernel from
  deadlocking, waiting during a DMA transfer that doesn't complete.  The cost during
  streaming is nil.  The cost for round-trip packets is at most a few FPGA cycles in
  the fast, PCIe clock domain and appears to be too small to notice.

- Add some simple debugging feedback of the PCIe channel outside RRR.

- Debug scan service now has a dead link timer that can be set to go off
  at a cycle interval (DEBUG_SCAN_DEADLINK_TIMEOUT).  This is useful
  when the host->FPGA channel deadlocks but the FPGA->host does not.  For
  simplicity, the timer fires whether or not the link is dead.

- Support scratchpad address spaces larger than 32 bits.

Add threads to speed up I/O:

 - Host -> FPGA messages now passed to a writer thread that merges messages into
   larger buffers.
 - FPGA -> host messages use a hybrid mode.  During a constant stream of data,
   read buffers are filled in a separate thread and passed, raw, to the main
   thread.  When no message buffer is ready, the primary thread takes control
   and handles the next PCIe read in order to avoid the latency of passing
   the buffer between threads.

The RRR test on our server with an ML605 now claims peak FPGA->host I/O of 650 MB/s
and pipelined bidirectional I/O of 850 MB/s.

The new code requires Intel's TBB (Thread Building Blocks) library.

Platforms may now define the AWB parameter N_TOP_LEVEL_CLOCKS.  When it exists,
the top-level wrapper exposes the requested number of Bluespec Clock types.
A single Reset is also exposed.  The first clock is exposed in the default
manner.  All others are exposed as a vector.  The default clock and the
remainder vector are then merged into a single vector and passed to the model.

Since platform programmers must give serious thought to correct clocking,
the platform continues to have no default clock.

This change makes it easy to import clocks and allows us to expose interfaces
referenced to top-level clocks.  Once connected to clocks, top-level
interface methods may be tagged always enabled.

The change will also ease support for other top-level wrappers that pass
in clocks, such as FaBRIC's Convey system.

Add a new class of metadata passed through the LEAP memory system for read
requests:  RL_CACHE_GLOBAL_READ_META.  For now, the struct has only one
field that indicates whether the request is a prefetch.  Unlike the other
metadata field, which is opaque and has meaning only to the module that
generates it, the global metdata has the same definition everywhere.

The first use of this (not yet implemented) will be to permit lower levels
of the hierarchy to treat prefetch requests differently than normal reads.

The global read metadata travels with both read requests and responses.  One
could argue it has no use with responses, but the structure is small and it
is now easy to add other fields.

- Generalize Hsin-Jung's bypassed BRAM code since it is useful outside
  prefetching:
  - Moved the code to mkWriteBeforeReadMemory in libRL.  Normal BRAM returns
    the old value when a read and write target the same memory location in a
    single cycle.  This version takes a read-before-write BRAM and adds the
    bypass, making it write-before-read.
  - Added a LUTRAM wrapper to leap-platforms that makes a LUTRAM look like
    a MEMORY_IFC.

- Prefetch code now uses the code above.

- Simplify the schedules around prefetching:
  - Add conservative_implicit_conditions to a few modules.
  - Add another rule to the direct mapped cache, breaking apart selection of
    the next request from testing whether the target is busy.  The separated
    rules communicate over wires, so the timing is unchanged.

New code implements dual write ports for 1-bit LUTRAMs using a pair of LUTRAMs.
Works with any type that can pack into Bit#(1).  Zero is encoded as both
identical values and one as different values for a given index.

The code works only if the same address is never passed to both write ports
in a given cycle.  This is not checked as a check would add scheduling
complexity and, in some cases, introduces a dependence between attempts
to use both write ports in parallel.

Tried the experiment of converting the central cache to direct mapped instead
of set associative.  The theory was that direct mapped is simpler (less
FPGA area), faster (fetch data and tag together) and that the lower latency
will overcome a slightly higher miss rate.  At least for our 1GB central
cache this did not work.  The latency did decrease, sometimes significantly
(18%), but the miss rate became a problem for many workloads.  We do hash
addresses, though with CRC because a better hash is too expensive for a cache.
The direct mapped cache used fewer FPGA resources, but not by much.

The question became: can we get the latency advantage of the direct mapped
cache with the hit rate of the set associate cache.  Yes!  This new code
prefetches an entire set when the tag is requested.  With three 256 bit
ways, the full memory access is only two SDRAM reads (512 bit) that are
returned as a total of four 256 bit beats.  Since requests are filtered
by private L1 caches, the extra SDRAM traffic does not affect throughput.

- Fix pseudo-multi-read memories.  The logic tried to monitor each read port
  and avoid deadlocks by allowing reads only when output buffer space is
  available.  The code deadlocked anyway, because all read ports were
  sent through the same request queue.  Separated queues and added an

1) Bug fix to leap-configure.  Generated header did not include
asim/syntax.h, even though they could use UINT64 and friends. One
wonders how things ever compiled.

2) Added feature to permit dynamic disabling of all printfs.  We use
them liberally sometimes and they interfere with perf runs.

- Add mkStdIO_CondPrintf, a wrapper for stdio that disables printing unless
  enabled by a run-time switch (--stdio-cond-printf-mask).  Clients
  of CondPrintf specify the bit in the mask that controls printing, allowing
  for different states among multiple wrappers.

  The wrapper provides its own buffering, allowing mutliple rules to
  write separate mkstdIO_CondPrintf instances while sharing a single
  STDIO instance.  The rules will not conflict statically, but may conflict
  dynamically if printing is enabled.

- Turn STDIO_ENABLE_DEBUG on by default now that there is a mechanism
  to compile debug code but disable printing.  In typical designs the
  space used for debugging is small.

1) Added a new library for building graphs of latency-insensitive modules (LIMs)

2) Using this library, during LEAP compilation we build a LIM graph
after producing the BSV log files. We partition this graph recursively
by making minimum cuts to form a tree of modules. This tree reduces
the scheduling burden on the Bluespec compiler for larger LIM graphs.  

3) Fixed a few minor bugs in the build pipeline due to the recent mask file generation.

4) Removed build of model.bo. This bo is subsumed by the model_Wrapper.bo.

Although I have not yet back-ported it, the li module library replace
several less-well-formed classes in the multifpga compiler.

1) Patched some stragging apms with new li_module library

2) Fixed codegen stage of LIM tree building to support multifpga
builds.  During the second pass of multifpga builds, some modules may
be removed.  This breaks the backend tools which expect some verilog
for these modules.  We now synthesize dummy modules to fix the backend
tools.

Refactored LIM library to include a first-class chain object.  The
multifpga compiler originally handled chains and channels as a
combined "connection" object.  However, this organization got ugly
quickly since the algorithms for channels and chains are fundamentally
different.

1) Added the capability to choose between a flat or tree-like module
infrastructure. Although final implementation results are consistent
between tree and flat builds, XST does not do a good job of optimizing
the tree build.  Also, the tree build currently lacks synthesis
parallelism making it somewhat slower than the flat build.

2) Added more commentary for recursive tree build functions.

3) Fixed small code style errors.

- Top-level build has grown large enough in some cases that the stack is too small
  in Xst.  We should make the top-level build smaller.  In the mean time, grow
  the stack.

- Tweaks to build rules to fix non-tree builds:
  - Pass command line options to depends-init sub-build so that run-time
    modifications to AWB parameters are consistent.
  - Add tree component Verilog files only when building trees.

FPGA programming scripts now check the return value of impact rather
than grepping through its output for known error cases.  This
prevents new error cases (like corrupt bitfiles) from being activated
and potentially wiping out the system on which they are run.

- Top level model now defines AWB parameters naming the leap_debug directory.

- Add a new "live" directory containing entries that affect the run or provide
  run-time status.  By default it is leap_debug/live.

- Debug scan code makes a "debug-scan" live file (a named pipe) that, when
  read, triggers a scan to the pipe.

1) Refactored run.bmark to support multiFPGA builds.  run.bmark now
interoggates FPGA sub-builds to find out which FPGAs are needed.  It
then programs all FPGAs in the system.  When the program step is done,
all FPGAs are activated, ensuring distributed reset. Finally, the
software side program is executed.

The new functionality supports only FPGAs attached to the same system.
Remote FPGA support is coming soon, as is support for multiple
software instances.

1) Changed tree build to support wrapper modules in the style of the other synthesis boundaries. Top level build now gets re-synthesized _only_ if top level connections change, as opposed to when the interface of some module changes. 

2) To support this we needed a means of introducing LI modules into the compilation flow at compile time.  This is now supported.  Refactoring was required in both the synthesis and bluespec build tools.

Both of these changes are steps on the road to a more general latency insensitive compiler.

Calling getBuildPipelineDebug inside a Python build action function causes
SCons to believe the action changes each compilation.  I'm not sure why.
Replaced the calls with a variable set outside the build action, which is
faster anyway.

- Generate hw/include/awb/provides/bsv_version_capabilities.bsh include file
  at build time with a set of preprocessor variables describing capabilities
  of the current Bluespec compiler.  Currently it indicates whether the Char
  type is implemented.

- Build a hash table for global strings.  The global strings code guarantees
  that both strings and UIDs are unique within a synthesis boundary.  The
  old code built a single list and searched it for each new string.
  This requires the new Char type in order to hash a string.  When Char is
  not implemented the hashed value is always 0, reducing the implementation
  to the previous single list.

- Provide a compile-time hash data type and functions (libRL).  Hash tables
  are associative lists of keys and values.

- Use hash tables for soft connections.  Extract the name of the connection
  from the old data type and use it as the key.

- Deprecate a number of modules used for the old many-to-one and one-to-many
  connections.  These have been broken for quite a while because they don't
  offer either performance gains or area improvements.
