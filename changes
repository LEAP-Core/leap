Initial cut at a Leap package, which extracts the non-modeling
components from the HAsim package and copies them here. This 
includes the build tools, non-modeling specific modules and 
submodels and the non-model demo designs. Changes include renaming
the build tools to leap-* from hasim-* and renaming the perl 
library to Leap:: from HAsim::. 

To use the Leap tools/modules one should check out the Leap package
and have a sufficiently new verion of the awb package installed
so that the leap-* tools are defined (in asimstarter). Finally,
the model (.apm file) must use the type 'Leap'.

To ease the transition from the modules in the HAsim package to
those in the Leap package, the modules and submodels continue to 
live in the the same relative (uniondir) directory (this includes 
the use of some hasim/ subdirectories in the Leap pacakge). That 
means that the uniondir mechanism will pick out the files from the
first package in the SEARCHPATH - preferably Leap. Checking out 
Leap after HAsim should result in the correct behavior.

Note further that all the modules and submodels in the Leap package
currently continue to exist in the HAsim package. This means that 
users who checkout HAsim and not Leap should be unaffected by 
changes in the Leap package. Soon, however, use of the HAsim package
without the Leap package will be deprecated as new functionality 
will only be added to the Leap tools and eventually redundant files
in the HAsim package will be deleted.

Migration of hasim commits 826,829,830 by kfleming

Added a more general test for MCD designs on a variety of platforms

A few minor changes:

  1) Added MCD testbench involving a scratchpad
  2) Filled in MCD struct, silencing some (but not all) MCD-related warnings
  3) Added RRR instantiation to Null Services 
       I believe that this is what was meant in the code 
       (given that it already included rrr.bsh)

Migration from hasim of r831 by kfleming

Two sets of modifications - some inexorable groundwork for multifpga
builds (in the sense that I couldn't unedit the files).  However,
these changes are ignored by downstream tools, and do not affect code
paths using the non-pipelined build.  There are some minor changes to
the hasim scripts.  Most of these are generalizations of code which
broke once I started building things from the root of the source tree,
as opposed to intervening nodes.  I also add an option for inserting a
hash into the generated verilog stub files.  This prevents unecessary
rebuilds when the corresponding wrappers change, but do not modify
thier interface.

Fixed bug in python includes - python __init__ is only viewable by
modules outside a package. This meant that the parameters of a package
were visible everywhere _except_ in the package.  We now generate a
config.py, the zen of python recommended practice.  I think it's ugly,
but it's workable.

MCD stage now generates better clock crossing ucf statements.  We also
generate xcf statements which prevent spurious BUFG instantiation, which was preventing larger designs from mapping sucessfully (and maybe also affecting functional correctness).

Fixed some rather obvious bugs that were preventing Altera builds from
completing.  That's all done now and bitfiles get produced.  I can
program the boards, but I suspect that there are some permissions
issues because I can't open nios2-terminal.  Should be fixable.

frequency to XCF files for synthesis boundaries, hopefully improving
synthesis quality.  mcd.tcl now emits a different path to the
oscillator for PLL devices.

In the SCons scripts, coerce commands in the hardware build
to be spawned under bash insteaad of sh. This allows the bsc 
log builder to work, even with the reference to the bash-only
$PIPESTATUS variable.

This eliminates what I believe to be the last reason for
requiring /bin/sh to be a reference to bash instead of dash.
This means that on Ubuntu systems, one doesn't need to
change the /bin/sh symbolic link to point at bash any more.

Moved stuff from platforms to leap:
* librl
* virtual_platform (including rrr, channelio, virtual_devices, llpi)
* fpgaenv APMs
* application_env

Deleted obsolete code:
* old dme/afu stuff

At this stage, no file names or UnionDir paths have been changed. Therefore many references to hasim
continue to exist.

Change benchmark setup/run to be much simpler and not performance-model specific. 
This is a stopgap until we implement our longterm "a.out" plan.

Change "hasim_debug" directory to "leap_debug." Update locations in librl.

Add LLPI pthread workaround temporarily until we can find a better longterm solution.

Resurrected verilog build pipeline (not fully, there are still some
mechanical steps which must be taken, like copying the vpi dynamic
libraries.  I also modified PAR to support xilinx 12 which moved the
placer table command line option to the map stage.

Reworked the bram fifo memory clear to be in main rule.  This has two effects:

1) BRAMFIFO now matches scheduling of Bluespec SizedFIFO exactly
2) Scheduling errors related to clear method are resolved.

* Add a build pipeline project that actually provides "project" instead of 
  "model".
  
* Update SCons pipeline templates to import @ROOT_MODEL@ rather than a 
  hardcoded "model."

* We are now ready to start switching to project at the top level! This will
  be done after the upcoming Leap file rearrangement.

Patch for the models broken by the previous check-in. This patch is
shaky in the sense the it special cases ROOT_DIR_MODEL in the
recursive SW configuration step in leap-configure.  The real solution
to this problem is probably moving the SW recursion into the build
pipeline, but that will take time.

* Major LEAP file reorganization to remove references to HAsim and obsolete file
naming conventions.

* In general, the content of files in this checkin are unchanged, just their
  names and locations on disks. Two exceptions:
  
  A) .awb files have been updated if source file names changed.
  B) .apm files have been updated with the new locations, and upgraded to format
     version 2.2 to facilitate finding moved files.

* Some concessions to backwards compatability has been made by keeping code
  that is obsolete but still supported. These modules are generally placed in
  directories called backwards-compat. Currently these files are planned to be
  removed once code refactoring is done.
  
* fpga-environment.awb was mistakenly left in platforms. Now moved to LEAP.

* Now that AWB better supports changed file locations, we should hopefully do
  these reorganizations incrementally and no longer have to do monster checkins
  on this magnitude.

Reworked memory fifo to use the FIFOCount interface.  We were already
tracking count as part of implementation, but now it can be optionally
exposed to the instantiator.  This was needed for implementing
rudimentary flow control to work around the rrr sw-handle thread's
deadlock issues.  I really wish it had non-blcoking writes.

Added xupv5 serial device.  Since serial is a general device, I reorganized it depend on a platform-specific ucf.  Some more work is needed.  1) we need to ensure a constant 100Mhz clock - this is not an issue for XUPv5 and XUPv2, but other platforms may not have an available 100Mhz oscillator.  2) I need more robust flow control enable/disable as some platforms, including XUPv5, do not support HW flow control.

Added new Synplify/XST hybrid build pipeline stage.  I gave up on an
entirely synplify-based solution -- the ucf files were killing me.
Rather now, we use XST to build the root model and Synplify to build
the synthesis boundaries.  This method is a good comprimise - things
like ucf can be shared and we still get most of the benefit of
synplify.  Using this pipeline, I have produced working bitfiles for
ACP and XUPV5-PCIE.

Also, I fixed a unportable symlink bug.  Python files are now linked
with relative symlinks.

Backported some typeclass instances from soft-service to
soft-connection so that newer codes can still build with the old build
script.  This is part of an effort to debug the bsv-build dependency
issue in the build pipeline, but it's also generally useful.

Fixes two problems in the pipeline build Bluespec stage:

1. Wrapper bo rebuilds need to force stub bo rebuilds
2. Bluespec-style synth boundaries need to force bluesim/verilog rebuilds.

The fix involves adding appropriate dependencies to ensure that these rebuilds occur.

The updated m5 no longer appends python code to the end of the binary.  Instead,
code is stored in statically constructed arrays as the program starts.  The
build rules are thus simpler.

* Reorganization of Soft Services using ModuleContext's built in support for 
  HList. This cleans up the definitions of individual services and removes the 
  need for lifting. Soft services are now defined by two typeclasses:
  SOFT_SERVICE, and SYNTHESIZABLE_SOFT_SERVICE.
  
* This reorganization probably could be taken even farther to remove some of the 
  dependencies in the "soft_services_lib -> soft_conn_lib -> soft_services -> 
  soft_conn -> soft_services_defs" dependence chain. However this is left to a
  future checkin as this revision already changes quite a lot.
  
* Port the "chunking of connections" to the soft service version of soft 
  connections.

* Support for multicast soft connections across synthesis boundaries is now
  included in leap-connect (using the new SOFT_SERVICES typeclasses above).
  
* Optional connections are now supported across synthesis boundaries by
  leap-connect.  

* Support for stations and trees is now enabled, but is not yet supported
  across synthesis boundaries.

* General cleanup and refactoring of Soft Connections code using new
  Dispatcher functions.

* With these changes the build pipeline now works with every known model.

* Change all models in leap to use the "Hybrid HW/SW Pipeline Project". The
  old monolithic SConscipt is still left for backwards compatability for now.
  
* Update all models in leap to use full Soft Services instead of just soft
  connections.

* Remove some references to "bsv-libraries" fork of librl-mit. This seems to be
  harmless.

* Compiling HAsim's alpha_unpipelined_exe model with the build pipeline & soft
  services is currently resulting in an internal compiler error. This
  change will allow regressions to pass until this is resolved.

- WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was an old, partial solution to the configuration in which
  unconnected applications define platform service devices on the software side
  but don't instantiate the hardware side.  WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE was the starter
  service.  Dynamic parameters have the same problem.  Applications that use
  software-side dynamic parameters were trying to send them to the hardware
  side and deadlocking.

  Drop WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE.  Instead, add PLATFORM_SERVICES_AVAILABLE to all
  application environments.

- Add a 'synth' build target to all FPGA synthesis SCons rules.  This is
  a convenient target for a single build that will be the basis of multiple
  cost table place and route attempts.

* Code cleanup in preparation for release. This basically means:
** Stricter adherence to coding/indenting conventions.
** Use of `include "asim/provides/foo.bsh" instead of "import foo::*"
** Adding copyright header to every code file.
** Replace older syntax like "Connected_Module" with new version. (Though no
   backwards compatability typedefs have been removed at this time.)

* Remove some empty files.

* Remove some lingering references to hasim (mostly in attributes)

* Remaining TODOs before release:
** Allow "asim/provides" to be replaced with "awb/provides"
** More READMEs and better documentation.

Added a tool for the multifpga parser.  This still needs a function
for invoking it from the build pipeline.  That's coming soon.

- Divided clock Verilog name was computed incorrectly.  (At least for all the
  models I tried.)

- Stop testing that the multiplier and divider match the target frequency
  in basic-clock.bsv.  The multiplier and divider are completely ignored.
  We should stop using explicit multipliers and dividers since we have code
  to compute them given an input and target frequency.

- Update the code for printing clock details for ACP.

Added a new function to retrieve build tree paths for files in
ModulList.  This could probably be a little more parametric.

Also, uppgraded the multi-fpga parser to the point that it can be used
in an apm as part of the multifpga build pipeline.  This pipeline
currently resides in a development repository so as not to pollute the
main line codes.

Extended the multifpga build tool to set up the platform apm in
private directory.  This is a stepping stone on the road to multifpga
compilation.

Turn the streams service into a ring instead of a single soft connection.
Now it supports multiple clients instead of a single writer.

Added an awb for multifpga soft connections. We need an extra
parameter and a couple of extra files.  I am creating a second awb to
avoid putting switches in the baseline code.

- Consolidate SCons debug printing in a single method (getBuildPipelineDebug)
  that allows requesting debug printing either on the SCons command line
  or by an AWB parameter.
- Debug parameter (BUILD_PIPELINE_DEBUG) is an integer.  The higher the number,
  the more detail may be emitted.
- Make the Verilog simulation build work:
  - Break out Bluespec Verilog libraries into a separate dependency group.
  - getAllDependencies now returns a unique list.
- Bluesim build now can build a Verilog simulator target instead using
  the SCons "vexe" target.  This is most often useful for switching to
  waveform debugging to match the generated .v file variable names.

- Remove cost table argument for par.  New Xilinx tools don't allow it.
- Add Bluespec-supplied XCF file to build pipeline.  Bluespec should do
  a better job providing a base template.  For now, we just use the
  XUPV5 version since templates for all current boards are identical.

* Fix a bug where models that did not have soft connections were not invoking
  the starter device correctly.
  
* Add a method called WaitForHardware() to the starter device. This mimics
  the functionality of the old WAIT_FOR_HARDWARE parameter in a much more
  flexible way.

* Change hello-world to use WaitForHardware().

* Note: due to a buffering issue in our run.pl script "Hello World" is sometimes
  not printed until after the application exits. This should be fixable by
  having the run.pl script wait for its forked child to exit. Direct command-
  line execution works perfectly. We should think about what the 
  "correct solution" for the IO buffering problem is....

* Replace #include "asim/provides/FOO.h" with "awb/provides/FOO.h"

* Build directories contain appropriate symlinks from "asim" to "awb" so
  existing code doesn't break.

* Update all files in Leap to the new convention.

* Ensure all #includes are using the correct convention.

Build pipeline changes for synthesis:

- Set the working directory properly during BSV (needed by Synplify)
- Set the source files correctly for ngdbuild
- Support multiple XCF files
- Fix Synplify (with Xst top level) build.
- Still broken:  Synplify does not work in parallel due to file conflicts.

- Change default ring data width to 128 bits instead of 320.  This was the
  default with the old system.

Finally, the build process appears to be stable with the new Bluespec compiler.

- Merged the Xst build pipeline controllers into a single module, controlled
  by an awb parameter.  They differed by only a single line, either running
  Bluespec's basicinout on the top level Verilog or not.
- Add an Xst command to treat Verilog case statements as parallel.  It is
  enabled by default, but can be turned off with an awb parameter.

- Bluespec now requires that an XCF file be applied to Xst builds in order to
  get correct results.  Unfortunately, there are Xst bugs triggered by the
  Bluespec default version.  (The usual Xst mishandling of RegFile storage.)
  Our LUTRAM implementation works around all known bugs, but the Bluespec
  XCF file interferes.

  I thought about modifying the XCF file in the Bluespec compiler's directory,
  but concluded that was a bad idea since every user would have to fix his
  own Bluespec installation.  Instead, I added bluespec.xcf here.  If the file
  ever becomes compiler-version specific we can manage that in the build
  pipeline.

So far, these rules have been tested with ISE version 11.5.

* Add over 100 README files. Each directory has a README file. Currently the
  quality of the README file varies based on the importance of the module and
  my understanding of its operation. Priority is given to "application-facing"
  APIs like Stats, Params, RRR, etc. Still, there is obviously room to improve
  many of these. I will be bothering original authors for contributions.
  
* Mark over 60 files as deprecated. These files will not make it into the next
  LEAP release. To find which files are deprecated "grep -r DEPRECATED *". If
  a directory contains a file named DEPRECATED in place of a README then the 
  entire directory is deprecated.

* A few files whose deprecated status is still under investigation are marked
  "DEPRECATED?" in their associated README files.

* No deprecated files are actually deleted in this release, but there 
  is some reorganization:
  ** Physical channel directories, especially pcie.
  ** Command-line switches is now in libraries/
  ** Platform services is now in libraries/
  ** Clean up some misc. file name conventions.
  
* There were two copies of the Streams device. Delete the extraneous one.

* Rename some ViCo modules to the more general "Hardware-Only" name, since
  they can be used with any platform that does not require a software component.

* Rename ViCo Physical Channel to "Passthrough" since it can be used for 
  any physical device that exposes UMF FIFOs.

* Add some copyright notices to misc. files.

* Update .awb files with new READMEs as %notes.

* Update .apm files so they are not stale.

* Next steps: create a branch which is a "release candidate" and does not
  contain deprecated files. This will give people an opportunity to complain
  if something was wrongly marked as deprecated.

* List of files whose deprecated status is under investigation. These are all
  related to soft services dependencies....

since the timing is unlikely.

 tool.py                   Locally Modified          153 

- Build sub-models in multi_fpga subdirectory of parent instead of in root.
- Build rule for sub-models generates a result other than the direct result
  of the sub model build.  The old code forced a rebuild of the top level BSV
  every time, even if it was built already.
- Return status of sub-model builds so parent SCons aborts correctly.

 XILINX_XST.py             Locally Modified          154 

Revert to previous version, where child xcf has the same contents as the top level.
Right now, the "top level" file has configuration for all synthesis boundaries.
It also has critical bluespec.xcf configuration.  Without these, builds below
top level are bound to have problems.

The real solution is more complicated and requires some notion of global vs.
local xcf configuration.

Xst was putting SyncFIFO buffers in BRAM!  Not only is this wasteful, it imposes
a more difficult timing on a structure we are forced to tag TIG.

mkSizedBRAMFIFO() now takes the size of the FIFO as an integer parameter instead
of a NumTypeParam#() hack.  The code internally is ugly (taken from the new
Bluespec-supplied version) since there is no good way to convert an integer
value to a type.  However, the interface now matches mkSizedFIFO() and is easier
to use.

- Enable multiprocessor mode in Xilinx map.

- Generate an error if the packed memory in-flight limit is greater than the
  scratchpad in-flight limit.

- Add buffering to the 1-to-many packed memory case since the underlying
  scratchpad ROBs are too small to support multiple reads from a single port.
  The code could be smarter and compute the mimimum extra buffering needed.
  I'll fix that, later.

- Use SCons "Copy" factory instead of "cp" because SCons stores the signature of
  the program in the build dependence.  If "cp" is a different binary it looks like
  rebuilding is needed.

  Removed mkdir from the rules instead of using "Mkdir" factory, since the
  directories appear to be present already and the factory version fails if
  the target exists.

- Clean up after others.  It didn't take long to make the Xilinx loader
  replacement of leap-xilinx-summary look good instead of an ugly hack.

- Restructure the memory packing code to be more efficient.  The old code was
  generated between a client requesting some number of read ports and an
  existing memory with the same number of read ports.  The new code takes
  a function that constructs the underlying memory.  The memory packer adds
  extra read ports to the underlying storage to satisfy the needs of the client
  and the needs of the memory packer.  As a result:

  - Read response buffering is no longer required.
  - The code is simpler.

- The 1:many packing case (multiple underlying buckets for a single client
  entry) no longer allocates a power of two container buckets.  Storage is thus
  used more efficiently.

- Tweak the allocation of ROB slots in the scratchpad code.  ROB slots are now
  allocated in the read request methods.  This avoids a deadlock case in
  which the client couldn't detect an impending deadlock due to a ROB filling
  in an internal rule.

- Removed the multi-cached scratchpad code with Elliott's consent.  It was
  no longer in active use and needs to be rethought:

  - The old code let clients specify different caches for each read port.  The
    client was forced to make assumptions about the way the memory packer
    was going to use read ports.

  - With the change in memory packing it would probably be a better idea
    to define a shim that inserts caches between individual read ports and
    a client for any instance of a multi-ported memory interface.

Elliott realized that most of the traffic in a HAsim multi-FPGA configuration
is from passing an empty token back and forth in the global scratchpad ring.
This is not a good use of the interconnect (duh), especially since traffic is
infrequent enough on that ring that no arbitration is needed.

 - Generalize the token ring and interface into an addressable ring.
 - Add a mkConnectionAddrRingNode() with the same addressable properties
   as the token ring but no token.  When a node has data it sends a message.

phase.  Airblue trips some of these cases with its rrr usage.  It's a

Move soft services and platform services into the FPGA environment.  All
LEAP applications now provide soft connections.

Aside from simplifying the application environment by reducing the number
of varients, this move permits code within the virtual platform to use
soft connections.  It used to be necessary to have platform services expose
soft connections to underlying virtual platform services.  Now a platform
service may implement the service fully.

- Expose local memory as soft connections in the virtual devices.

- Connect to local memory in the central cache through the soft connections.

- Revert to a bypass FIFO on local memory read response in the central cache
  to save a cycle.

  I had switched to a latency one FIFO because it made a bug that we had not yet
  diagnosed go away with multiple lanes in multi-FPGA.  The source of the bug
  has since been identified (compiling with different options in the two
  multi-FPGA passes).

- Move all scratchpad support to platform services.  The scratchpad code
  is now removed from virtual devices.

- Take advantage of soft connections within the scratchpad implementation:

  - The memory connector is now chosen as part of the configuration and is
    implemented below the scratchpad.

  - For hybrid connectors, the code now automatically instantiates the
    connector appropriate to the platform.  For single FPGA systems a simple
    RRR connector is allocated.  For multi-FPGA systems, FPGA 0 gets an RRR
    connector and a ring stop for forwarding remote requests to RRR.  All
    other FPGAs get just a ring stop for sending requests to FPGA 0.
    This eliminates separate AWB configurations and sources for the 3 cases.

  running that release, yet.  Put a version of relpath in Utils.py.

- Remove scratchpad include from NULL std virtual devices.  Scratchpad code
  is now in the platform services.

  Will deal with renaming NULL devices to something more meaningful later.

Move central cache implementation to platform services.  Now that the
implementation is in a domain that accepts soft connections, moved statistics
and deadlock debug dump code local to the code that uses it.

The NULL central cache implementation continues to route incoming requests
directly to the backing storage so clients of the NULL central cache see
exactly the same semantics as a real cache, differing only in timing.

Move shared memory, the last of the memory components, from virtual devices
to the platform services.  As shared memory is a work in progress only
the NULL version "works."  The hybrid version needs a virtual device shim
to map the llpi shared memory to soft connections.

To reduce variants of virtual device APM files, standard virtual devices and
common utility devices now configure themselves automatically for master and
slave in multi-FPGA environments.

When there is no local memory a central cache will always miss. The synthesis
tools can't detect that most of the cache could be optimized away.  In this case,
don't bother instantiating a real set associative cache.  Instead, route requests
directly to the backing storage.

Memory services in the platform may now be compiled as a separate synthesis
boundary.  All that is needed is a "%param SYNTH_BOUNDARY mkMemServices" in
the AWB file.

It can't be turned on yet because there is no syntax in the multi-FPGA
code to describe synthesis regions that belong on all FPGAs.
